details)\n3. pharmaceutical\nin the late 19th century through the early 20th century, new york became the home of the rockefeller institute for medical research (now rockefeller university). the institute is where the modern pharmaceutical industry was born. the institute pioneered many of the approaches the pharmaceutical industry uses today, including the preparation of vaccine serums, for better or worse. the vaccine used in the fort riley experiment on soldiers was made in horses.\nus mortality rates data from the turn of the 20th century to 1965 clearly indicates that clean water, flushing toilets, effective sewer systems and refrigerated foods all combined to effectively reduce mortality from infectious diseases before vaccines for those diseases became available.\nhave doctors and the pharmaceutical manufacturers taken credit for reducing mortality from infectious disease which rightfully belongs to sandhogs, plumbers, electricians and engineers?\nif hubris at the rockefeller institute in 1918 led to a pandemic disease which killed millions of people, what lessons can we learn and apply to 2018?\nthe disease was not spanish\nwhile watching an episode of american experience on pbs a few months ago, i was surprised to hear that the first cases of \u201cspanish flu\u201d occurred at fort riley, kansas in 1918. i thought, how is it possible this historically important event could be so badly misnamed 100 years ago and never corrected?\nwhy \u201cspanish\u201d?\nspain was one of a few countries not involved in world war i. most of the countries involved in the war censored their press.\nfree from censorship concerns, the earliest press reports of people dying from disease in large numbers came from spain. the warring countries did not want to additionally frighten the troops, so they were content to scapegoat spain. soldiers on all sides would be asked to cross no man\u2019s land into machine gun fire, which was frightening enough without knowing that the trenches were a disease breeding ground.\none hundred years later, it\u2019s long past time to drop \u201cspanish\u201d from all discussion of this pandemic. if the flu started at a united states military base in kansas, then the disease could and should be more aptly named.\nin order to prevent future disasters, the us (and the rest of the world) must take a hard look at what really caused the pandemic.\nit is possible that one of the reasons the spanish flu has never been corrected is that it helps disguise the origin of the pandemic.\nif the origin of the pandemic involved a vaccine experiment on us soldiers, then the us may prefer calling it spanish flu instead of the fort riley bacteria of 1918, or something similar. the spanish flu started at the location this experimental bacterial vaccine was given making it the prime suspect as the source of the bacterial infections which killed so many.\nit would be much more difficult to maintain the marketing mantra of \u201cvaccines save lives\u201d if a vaccine experiment originating in the united states during the years of primitive manufacturing caused the deaths of 50-100 million people.\n\u201cvaccines save lives \u2026 except we may have killed 50-100 million people in 1918-19\u201d is a far less effective sales slogan than the overly simplistic \u201cvaccines save lives.\u201d\nthe disease which killed so many was not flu or a virus. it was bacterial.\nduring the mid-2000\u2019s there was much talk about \u201cpandemic preparedness.\u201d influenza vaccine manufacturers in the united states received billions of taxpayer dollars to develop vaccines to make sure that we don\u2019t have another lethal pandemic \u201cflu,\u201d like the one in 1918-19.\ncapitalizing on the \u201cflu\u201d part of spanish flu helped vaccine manufacturers procure billion dollar checks from governments, even though scientists knew at the time that bacterial pneumonia was the real killer. miller\u2019s review ... miller, neil z. best price: $8.32 buy new $14.48 (as of 04:45 utc -

another person to join in a mutiny, for which the 60-year-old could have faced up to life in prison.\na canadian armed forces officer who publicly urged other military members to disobey orders and not help distribute covid-19 vaccines apologized thursday, saying he regreted his actions and \"public display of disloyalty.\"\nofficer cadet laszlo kenderesi delivered the apology at the start of his court martial where he was scheduled to be tried on three separate charges, including one of endeavouring to persuade another person to join in a mutiny.\nhowever, military prosecutors told the court shortly after the start of kenderesi's trial at canadian forces base borden that they had withdrawn the mutiny charge, which carried a maximum penalty of up to life in prison.\na short time later, kenderesi pleaded guilty to one charge of conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline before entering a not-guilty plea to the third charge of behaving in a scandalous manner unbecoming an officer.\nthe charges relate to a speech at an anti-lockdown rally in toronto's dundas square on dec. 5, 2020, in which kenderesi appeared in full military uniform and spoke out against what he called \"killer\" vaccines.\n\"i'm calling upon all military personnel to do the same, not to accept any unjust orders, which would be giving out and distributing vaccines,\" kenderesi told rally participants, according to a transcript read in court.\na video of his comments was later published online.\nthe armed forces had only days earlier received formal orders to start planning for the distribution of vaccines across the country, as health canada entered the final stages of reviewing vaccine candidates from pfizer and moderna.\non thursday, kenderesi expressed remorse for his

trucking business, after which he declared bankruptcy.\ncourt also heard that while kenderesi first joined the canadian armed forces in 1978 and served for years as reserve cadet instructor in borden, he had virtually no contact with the military after 2018.\nbut even as defence lawyer maj. alexandre gelinas-proulx sought to use these as mitigating factors, prosecutor lt.-cmdr. jennifer besner argued that the underlying issue was one of enforcing discipline in the ranks.\n\"discipline is the quality that every cf member must have, which allows him or her to put the interests of canada and the interests of the canadian forces before personal interests,\" besner said.\n\"this is necessary because canadian forces members must willingly and promptly obey lawful orders that may have very devastating personal consequences.\"\nbesner and gelinas-proulx nonetheless agreed in asking that pelletier sentence kenderesi to a severe reprimand and $4,200 fine. they added the officer cadet has already served 80 hours of community service.\npelletier appeared to acknowledge the precedent that his ruling would set for future cases, calling it unique due to the context of the pandemic as well as the public nature of the officer cadet's comments.\n\"it's not an internal rant,\" pelletier added.\nthe results of kenderesi's case could indeed have repercussions on future courts martial for armed forces members who have publicly spoken out against vaccine mandates and other government policies.\nthat includes warrant officer james topp, the army reservist who was charged earlier this year with two counts of conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline for speaking out against vaccine requirements while wearing his uniform.\ntopp has since become a celebrity of sorts for

on what we're seeing.\nfor all 2016 and 2018 comparisons, the red/blue bars are elevated from the prior published data in grey for every single major diagnostic category reported. we leave out the \"other\" category that underwent redefinition. for just one major diagnostic category, the blue bars are elevated above the red bars. we will talk about the importance of the difference. we are examining large collections of different illnesses in the diagnostic categories that follow. there are thousands of icd-10 codes within each of these categories. there may be 2%, 45%, and 700% changes in incidence of illness or injury for various icd-10 codes or collections thereof that describe a specific disease, whereas the change for the overall diagnostic category may be 4% or 12% or 30%, depending on how it all balances together. a large change of rate in an illness with a low rate of incidence may barely impact the change of rate in illness over the larger diagnostic category.\ni hope i've made this list plain enough. you can look back here if need be.\nthe following ordering of the categories is essentially from the greatest incidence (in terms of ambulatory reports) to the least. many of the more interesting categories are near the bottom.\nmusculoskeletal system and connective tissue (icd-10: m00-m99)\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 4.5% and 4.9%, respectively in this large category. this is one of the smaller changes among the major diagnostic categories, which is consistent with observed distributions of vaccine-associated illness.\nmental health disorders (icd-10: f01-f99)\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 6.5% and 6.2%, respectively in this large category. this is one of the smaller changes among the major diagnostic categories. personally, i view the observed rise in mental illness as primarily related to the stress that terrible and terrifying policy has placed citizens under, including the psychological nudges.\nnervous system and sense organs (icd-10 codes: g00-g99,h00-h95)\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 6.5% and 7.2%, respectively in this large category. this is still a smaller than average change, but to a large enough category that zooming in may prove interesting.\nsigns, symptoms, and ill-defined conditions (icd-10 codes: r00-r99)\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 11.7% for each year in this diagnostic category. this may prove to be the most interesting diagnostic category. most major diagnostic categories tend toward correlated disease expression. in this category, diseases and injuries are themselves not the important aspect. these codes are defined by cases in which the etiology is in question. this would be a place where we should expect to see physicians either confused about what a vaccine injury represents or not wanting to state with certainty or believe that a particular vaccine injury is an injury. i talked about this previously, but the second revision of the 2016-2020 data, which is quite large (46.6% on average), looks suspiciously like cover for dramatically higher rates of illness tossed into this bucket.\nthe post-glitch queries look molded to indicate a trend was already taking place. but there is no such pre-pandemic trend in any other data i've looked at (outside of military database outputs), much less in the other major diagnostic categories.\nsome of these categories are likely matches for effects of the quasi-vaccines, and there are many more that do aside from the list below:\n(r01x) cardiac murmurs and other cardiac sounds\n(r03x) abnormal blood-pressure reading, without diagnosis\n(r04x) hemorrhage from respiratory passage\n(r07x) pain in throat and chest\n(r09x) other symptoms and signs involving the circulatory and respiratory system\n(r22x) localized swelling, mass and lump\n(r77.1) abnormality of globulin\n(r77.8) other specified abnormalities of plasma proteins\nit may also be that cases categorized as r-codes get recategorized down the road as etiologies are better understood, so illnesses that currently show no increase or modest increase in rates in 2021 could wind up showing substantial increases as the dust settles.\nexpect me to have a lot more to say about the r-codes down the road, and with as much resolution as we can get.\ninjury and poisoning (icd-10 codes: s00-t98; dod0101-dod0105)\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 3.7% and 4.5%, respectively in this diagnostic category. my priors are that we will only find interesting stories in this data when we drill down for higher resolution, so not much to say for now. however, this category does include a couple of key icd-10 codes with respect to vaccinations.\nthere are over 2,000 reports of severe adverse events among military personnel in vaers, which is a database notoriously underreported by factors as high as 100. the distribution of these events skews toward older populations, meaning that military leadership is likely more affected by serious adverse events or even death associated with the experimental covid-19 quasi-vaccines.\nfrom 2020 to 2021, the number of ambulatory reports of poisoning by or adverse events associated with viral vaccines leapt from 113 to 1696 in dmed, more than 15 times as high.\nrespiratory system (icd-10 codes: j00-j99)\nrespiratory system (icd-10 codes: j00-j99)\nwhile i would have initially focused more on this diagnostic category, it turns out that most of the codes here have no relationship to either covid-19 or vaccination. a larger portion of serious vaccine adverse events are blood, circulatory, immune-oriented, or related to the nervous system. we will only find interesting elements of the data as we zoom in for a later article.\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 6.0% and 6.3%, respectively in this diagnostic category. there are some very serious stories to talk about here, but i'll go ahead and point out that covid-19 itself was not categorized among the j-codes.\npregnancy and delivery (icd-10 codes: relevant z-codes; o00-o99)\napologies for not having the dmed queries totals here. i will likely come back and edit this chart later. i was not aware of the missing data when i got started. basically, i outsourced most of the analysis of this category, so i'll have more to say here when i get into higher resolution stories.\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 4.7% and 5.8%, respectively in this diagnostic category. for obvious reasons, there is a great deal of attention on this category. even small changes here can have profound effects on civilization. but for the moment we are staying at medium resolution, and i can't drop hints because the workload has been enough (and this category has been toughest to analyze) that i do not yet have answers.\nskin and subcutaneous tissue (icd-10 codes: l00-l99)\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 6.1% and 7.0%, respectively in this diagnostic category.\ngenitourinary system (icd-10 codes: n00-n99)\nthose worried about fertility issues should look beyond just the pregnancy category. this is one of the categories with related coding for illness and injury.\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 15.4% and 15.9%, respectively in this diagnostic category. these are extraordinary changes not to be explained in a database, and the importance of this category of disease and illness cannot be understated since it represents systemic risk to national and world populations.\ndigestive system (icd-10 codes: k00-k95)\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 10.5% and 10.4%, respectively in this diagnostic category. if a rise in the rate of digestive system illness due to spike protein or some other aspect of the experimental covid-19 quasi-vaccines is not intuitive to you (and it wasn't at first to me), watch joshua guetzkow's talk.\ninfectious and parasitic diseases (icd-10 codes: a00-b99)\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 16.6% and 17.9%, respectively in this highly relevant diagnostic category. there will be a great deal to talk about as we zoom in on these massive upward revisions. but to give a sneak preview, we can see that as the highly vaccinated military moved through their rollout\u2014and especially when the mandates were pushed out in the late summer, covid-19 cases became more severe on average as indicated by hospitalization rates, among military personnel.\nrates of several key infectious diseases are exploding, and that will be talked about in depth in another article.\nendocrine, nutrition, immunity (icd-10 codes: e00-e89)\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised a whopping 50.3% and 52.5%, respectively in this diagnostic category. we don't even need to drill down to understand the level of hiding massive signals of illness here.\ncirculatory system (icd-10 codes: i00-i99)\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 13.1% and 13.6%, respectively in this diagnostic category. it will be interesting to drill down to see what safety signals might be hidden by such revisions.\nneoplasms (icd-10 codes: c00-d49)\nthis is the category under which cancers are deposited. the neoplasms are the cancerous growths.\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 12.3% and 14.3%, respectively in this diagnostic category. if these rates were raised to cover up signals from 2021 alone, we're going to see a lot worse, and soon. this is one of the categories i've already explored a bit, but i hope to get a little time asking dr. ryan cole a few questions before i write that article. dr. long's stories have been concerning enough.\nhematologic and immune disorders (icd-10 codes: d50-d89)\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 31.6% and 32.7%, respectively in this diagnostic category.\ncongenital anomalies (icd-10 codes: q00-q99)\nthe 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 9.9% and 11.1%, respectively in this diagnostic category. unfortunately, i left this category out of initial analysis, so we're piecing this one together now.\nparting thoughts\nif the revisions were not intentionally deceiving, the revelation is that enormous amounts of historical data would have been entirely misunderstood by physicians and biomedical researchers and in crucial ways.\na shout out to the team working with me on this project, which includes not only the three whistleblowers (drs. theresa long, samuel sigoloff, and peter chambers), but several volunteers who aren't looking for any spotlight and mostly want to remain anonymous. their courage and humility are felt.\nspecial thanks to drs. heather gessling, ryan cole, richard urso, lynn fynn, mary talley bowden, and ben marble for advice on the next stage of this project that will involve zooming in for higher resolution. in how many ways can these astounding physicians help during all the plandemonium? whenever i've put in effort with the data, these and others have been happy to step up and spend time with me, whether in framing the context of data, or narrowing my search parameters so that i could work more efficiently. after all, there are hundreds of thousands of icd-10 codes.\ni'd like to once again thank readers and particularly paid subscribers for their support\u2014particularly during this project. it occurs to me that i passed a one year publishing anniversary (has it been that long?), though still not a one year anniversary for the first paid subscription. for the first couple of months, i didn't know there was a button to turn on paid subscriptions. this wasn't intended to be a full time job, but here we are, and i'm grateful to be able to pay the bills having given up my last business plan as i watched such concerning levels of policy and data fraud unfold on so many levels.",

    "heather elkins, 45, couldn\u2019t get a medical exemption from her employer\u2019s covid-19 vaccine mandate despite a pre-existing heart condition \u2014 now she can\u2019t work at all.\nmiss a day, miss a lot. subscribe to the defender's top news of the day. it's free.\nwhen her employer in 2021 mandated all employees get the covid-19 vaccine, heather elkins, who had a pre-existing heart condition, requested a medical exemption.\nbut the oregon department of human services turned down her application \u2014 even though elkins had transitioned, in 2020, to a permanent work-from-home employee.\nelkins told the defender:\n\u201call state of oregon employees were mandated by gov. kate brown to be fully vaccinated from covid-19 or to meet a qualifying exemption regardless of if the employee was working from home or not and if we did not comply, we would lose our job!\u201d\nelkins, 45, was reluctant to get the vaccine for several reasons, she said:\n\u201ci am by no means against vaccines. with that being said, i was not comfortable with the covid-19 vaccine for a number of reasons. first, i didn\u2019t feel like there was enough known about it and the long-term effects it might have.\n\u201csecond, i saw reports stating people were developing heart issues, and given that i myself have a heart issue, i wasn\u2019t feeling comfortable with getting the vaccine.\u201d\nshe added: \u201cit\u2019s my body and the decision should be my choice! i know how my body reacts to trauma, illness, etc. i should be able to choose what goes in it.\u201d\nelkins tried every available avenue in her attempt to get an exemption. she told the defender:\n\u201ci spoke to management, hr and my union, [service employees international union] seiu, multiple times about how uneasy i felt getting the covid-19 vaccine. i also spoke with my doctors \u2026 multiple times about my concerns and asked for a medical exemption. they kept advising me to get the vaccine and stated the \u2018reward outweighs the risk.\u2019\n\u201ci even contacted my cardiologist \u2026 and was transferred to my cardiologist\u2019s nurse, who stated: \u2018we are not advising on whether or not you should receive the covid-19 vaccine.\u2019\u201d\nelkins said given the vaccines were causing heart issues, she thought her cardiologist, of all people, would be willing to weigh in.\n\u201cthat wasn\u2019t the case here, she said. \u201cthey turned a blind eye.\u201d\nafter she ran out of options \u2014 including not meeting the requirements for a religious exemption, either \u2014 elkins was forced to choose between the vaccine and her job.\nsymptoms occurred \u2018within an hour\u2019 of first pfizer shot\nelkins got the pfizer vaccine on sept. 12, 2021, and \u201cwithin about an hour,\u201d she said, began experiencing adverse reactions.\nthe reactions she experienced after the first shot didn\u2019t qualify her for a medical exemption from the second shot, she said:\n\u201ci even asked for a medical exemption from the second dose of the vaccine after several visits to the doctor for severe symptoms after receiving the first dose of pfizer.\n\u201ci was told that they were not giving medical exemptions because the \u2018reward outweighs the risk.\u2019\u201d\nso despite continued efforts to secure a medical exemption, elkins received her second pfizer shot on oct. 3, 2021, and experienced \u201cthe same severe reaction as with the first dose.\u201d\nthe symptoms included \u201csevere headache[s], severe muscle aches, [a] racing heartbeat \u2026 nausea, severe fatigue and dizziness/balance issues, chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath [and] a severe cough,\u201d she said.\na year later, elkins continues to experience symptoms that affect her ability to work.\nelkins told the defender:\n\u201cto date, i\u2019m experiencing all the same issues in addition to other symptoms like brain fog, horrible joint pain, pins and needles sensations, painful nerve zaps, shakiness and tremors in my hands and feet, and vision issues.\n\u201cat times, some of the symptoms are worse than others, but the symptoms as a whole have been so debilitating daily, i eventually couldn\u2019t continue working and have had to go on workman\u2019s compensation for now.\u201d\nprior to getting the vaccines, elkins said she was \u201cliving a normal life, walking and jogging several times a week for exercise and living a normal life.\u201d\nbut now, she said, \u201ci\u2019ve now been mostly confined to my bed for the last 11 months, unable to do minimal activities because of my debilitating symptoms,\u201d she said. \u201ctasks that seemed easy before, like working on crafts, doing the dishes, cooking or a trip to the store is physically exhausting and my symptoms are overwhelming.\u201d\nafter visiting a succession of doctors \u2014 including her primary physician, a covid-19 recovery specialist, a physical therapist, a speech therapist, a cardiologist, a pulmonologist, a rheumatologist, a neurologist and an ophthalmologist \u2014 elkins was diagnosed with dysautonomia, a condition characterized by a malfunctioning autonomic nervous system, she said.\n\u201cmost of the doctors i\u2019ve seen think i\u2019m having some kind of immune response to the vaccine but don\u2019t know why or how to stop it because so little is known.\u201d\nshe\u2019s tried a variety of medications and treatments, including physical therapy, speech therapy, a clean diet and even celery juice, but \u201cnone of them seem to be helping,\u201d elkins said.\n\u201cthe pulmonologist has me on a steroid inhaler which helps so long as i\u2019m not having long conversations or exerting myself.\nshe added:\n\u201ci have no personal life because every time i try to leave home and do anything social, my symptoms are exacerbated. i spend most of my days in bed. and on good days, i make it out to the living room to rest in a recliner.\u201d\nalthough she was unable to secure a medical exemption for her first or second doses, elkins said that she has \u201cnow been told i can have an exemption from the booster\u201d \u2014 but only after \u201cmultiple visits with multiple doctors,\u201d who told her that the reaction she experienced \u201cis severe.\u201d\nelkins said her primary doctor \u201chas since apologized to me verbally for not listening to my concerns when i asked for the medical exemption.\u201d\nthough too late to help elkins, her employer subsequently removed the mandate, \u201cat the same time they were doing a big hiring push for new employees,\u201d she said.\ngovernment \u2018sweeping it under the rug, like it isn\u2019t real\u2019\nthough friends and family have provided some support, they don\u2019t fully understand what she\u2019s experiencing, elkins said.\n\u201ceither they are supportive quiet, or just try to explain away the reason for my symptoms such as\u2026 \u2018maybe the vaccine exacerbated a condition you already had that you didn\u2019t know about or that was dormant.\u2019\u201d\nelkins, who said she knows \u201cwith 100% certainty that i was healthy prior to the covid-19 vaccine,\u201d has found a greater level of support through online support groups for vaccine-injured groups \u2014 including the vaccine injury/side effects support group, real not rare and react19.\n\u201cthey\u2019ve all been a wealth of information,\u201d she said.\neven though \u201cit\u2019s sad to hear the stories being shared,\u201d elkins said, \u201cit\u2019s comforting to know that others understand and know what it\u2019s like to go through what you are [going through]. these side effects are debilitating and it is very easy to become depressed, even if you\u2019re someone like me who has never really experienced that in the past.\u201d\nshe said the people in these support groups are \u201cvital\u201d to healing. \u201cnot only are we able to relate to one another, but these \u2018perfect strangers\u2019 understand in ways your closest family members and friends can\u2019t.\u201d\nelkins hopes these groups \u2014 and the vaccine-injured individuals who are speaking out \u2014 will translate to pressure on governmental authorities.\n\u201cour government needs to take accountability for the lack of transparency with the covid-19 vaccines,\u201d said elkins. \u201ctheir lack of transparency and shadiness surrounding adverse reactions is hurting so many, but they just continue sweeping it under the rug like it isn\u2019t real or happening.\u201d",

    "the military is waging a two-front war on its most conservative members.\non one front is the foolish and otherwise unlawful implementation and execution of the armed services\u2019 covid-19 vaccine mandate. religious accommodation requests to the vaccines have been categorically denied by the military branches. as of february of this year, 25,000 service members have requested the military accommodate their request to forego vaccination in light of their sincerely-held religious beliefs. less than 10 had been approved, with zero approvals in the army and navy.\naccording to one court, \u201cthe air force's process to protect religious rights is both illusory and insincere. in short, it\u2019s just \u2018theater.\u2019\u201d another court found the military actively disfavoring religious exemptions: \u201cthe mandate treats those with secular exemptions more favorably than those seeking religious exemptions.\u201d in other words, the military is openly and proudly hostile to religious service members, forcing them under threat of punishment to choose the vaccines over their faith.\nas to the mandate\u2019s implementation generally, the military doesn\u2019t recognize natural immunity. we all know that natural immunity is robust and long-lasting. certainly more so than that of the vaccines. the dod, led by secretary austin, chooses to ignore this data in favor mandatory vaccination for all.\nthen there is the unlawful required administration of vaccines authorized under an emergency use authorization (eua), since the officially \u201clicensed\u201d vaccines remain unavailable. what makes that unlawful? the president must authorize the administration of eua vaccines to the military \u2013 and he hasn\u2019t.\nthe other front, related to the first, involves the culture generally. back in 2017, there were reports that army training allowed for male soldiers identifying as women to wash in female showers. units were to adjust to transgender identity. this issue reappeared this week, with reporting from the washington free beacon providing source documents of the army\u2019s transgender service policy which states:\n\u201cgender transition in the army begins when a soldier receives a diagnosis from a military medical provider indicating that gender transition is medically necessary.\u201d\nthis comes after the military\u2019s celebration of pride month this past june, and west point cadets being taught critical race theory \u2013 including this slide on \u201cwhiteness.\u201d\nin the face of this evidence, secretary of defense lloyd austin maintains the dod is \u201capolitical.\u201d joint chiefs of staff chair gen. mark milley declares the u.s. military is an \u201capolitical institution.\u201d\nyet it\u2019s easy to see which groups the current regime favors. they\u2019re not being subtle about it. trans soldiers are given wide latitude to exercise their gender identity. the pious are discharged. sexual identity is celebrated. white skin color is condemned as original sin. (maybe i should say both sides are pious. they just worship different gods/gods.)\nin the midst of all this, or more accurately \u2013 because of all this \u2013 \u201cevery branch of the u.s. military is struggling to meet its fiscal year 2022 recruiting goals.\u201d according to data obtained by nbc news, there is \u201cboth a record low percentage of young americans eligible to serve and an even tinier fraction willing to consider it.\u201d\nwhy the drop? rod dreher, discussing jeff groom\u2019s article in the spectator, references the point of view of the recruited, saying:\n\u201cat some point, you\u2019ve got to realize that it\u2019s a scam, that you are being asked to risk your life to fight for an imperial order that thinks your law-abiding, church-going, palefaced right-wing self is the problem with america.\u201d\nwe observe that what was once imperialism is now imperialism with progressivism on top. it has the same appetite for power and dominance \u2013 and it will continue to satisfy that appetite through deceit \u2013 but at least it will do so in a progressive manner. cue the memes.\nnot that we should be surprised by this. the institutional disregard of the lives of the military service members has been an undisputed fact for years. the us government prioritized the war effort and corporate profits when it covered-up the deadly effects of agent orange during the vietnam war. in the 1980s, the cdc continued the cover-up, lying about military records and the link between birth defects and agent orange.\nin the more recent past, we lost approximately 2,450 american service members and spent over $2 trillion in afghanistan. lies from military leadership kept america in that war, undoubtedly leading to the death of thousands of americans and untold amounts of money. those promises from u.s. generals about progress? the data points were \u201caltered\u201d to paint a picture of success that wasn\u2019t true. how were they not complicit in the deaths of american troops?\ni ask that question to reframe the issue. mandates and woke politics are the current dilemma. but it\u2019s all manifested from rot that has been persistent deep in the military\u2019s bones. at least we\u2019re now seeing it for what it is.\nbrief update for members below:",

    "dod edits medical database to hide military covid-19 vaccine injuries as u.s. military is decimated by the mandatory shots\n% of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents.\nby brian shilhavy\neditor, health impact news\nlt. col. peter chambers has a 38-year career in the military. he is a green beret commander having served in the special forces, and he is a military doctor, serving as a flight surgeon and combat medic. he has earned the purple heart and bronze star medal, as well as other military awards for his service.\nlt. col. peter chambers became a whistleblower after suffering neurological issues following mandatory covid-19 vaccines, and seeing similar vaccine injuries in other soldiers, including: strokes, blood clots, cerebral bleeding, and various neurological injuries.\nhe began to research vaccine injuries following the covid-19 vaccines that were mandated for service members, in the defense medical epidemiology database (dmed) sponsored by the dod.\nhe has most recently been deployed in texas, near the texas-mexico border as a task force surgeon, where he began to provide \u201cinformed consent\u201d counseling to over 3000 soldiers at the border regarding the covid-19 vaccines, sharing with them the data he had uncovered in dmed, vaers, nih and other government sources.\nbeing in texas, he also informed them that doctors could prescribe early treatments for covid, such as ivermectin, which are very effective in overcoming the symptoms associated with covid-19.\nas a result, only 6 service members out of 3000 decided to comply with the covid-19 vaccine mandates.\ndr. chambers was approached by a 2-star general who asked why his vaccination rates were so low, to which he replied:\nsir, we have a regulation, ar 40-562 chapter 8 paragraph 4, clearly states that under emergency use authorization, i must do informed consent. it\u2019s a regulation. sir, i do things legally, morally, ethically, and first of all \u201cdo no harm.\u201d\nthe general allegedly became very angry with dr. chambers and stated:\nyou will cease and desist giving those informed consents.\ndr. chambers looked at him straight in the eye and replied:\nsir, that is an unlawful order, and i will not follow that order.\nthe general then allegedly fired him on the spot, and dr. chambers\u2019 military career was basically over at that point.\ndr. chambers replied:\nok. but sir, i am the only medical doctor down here on the border. do you have anybody else? we\u2019re getting shot at once in a while, you know that, i am a combat trauma doctor, and i\u2019ve stopped a lot of bleeding.\nafter informing the general that he had filed a whistleblower complaint, the general did some checking, and about an hour later stated that dr. chambers was not fired, but that he would be replaced.\ndr. chambers had joined dr. theresa long, another military doctor who is also a flight surgeon, in a lawsuit filed by attorney thomas renz against the u.s. military\u2019s mandatory covid-19 vaccination program.\nlisten to the whole interview between dr. chambers and steve kirsch recorded back in march of this year. it is 21 minutes long, and well worth the time to watch!\nat the end of this interview, dr. chambers stated: \u201cif we don\u2019t stop this, our military is going to be decimated.\u201d\nwithin a day or two of this interview, their whistleblower case reached the u.s. supreme court which ruled 6-3 against navy seals being entitled to a religious exemption for covid-19 vaccine mandates.\nat the same time, new york city mayor eric adams issued an executive order that exempted professional sports players and the entertainment industry from having to comply with covid-19 vaccine mandates. see:\ninsanity is the new norm in the u.s. as professional sports players can be exempt from covid vaccine mandates but navy seals cannot\nnow, just the news is reporting that dr. chambers and other military medical doctor whistleblowers can no longer depend upon the data in dmed because \u201c[the] dod took down, edited and restored the defense medical epidemiology database earlier this year after whistleblowers including chambers testified on the reported spike (in vaccine injuries) in a legal challenge.\u201d\nthe department told politifact \u2026. the 2021 spike was the product of a \u201cglitch\u201d that caused severe underreporting of 2016-2020 figures. that would mean the military underreported cases by about 20 million a year during that period, whistleblower lawyer tom renz said. chambers told just the news that dmed used to be more trustworthy than the government\u2019s vaccine adverse events reporting system but now it\u2019s \u201ccompletely unusable\u201d because dod changed many diagnoses that suggested vaccine injury after the military doctors went public. working on the border with the texas national guard, he personally observed highly unusual problems in \u201ca healthy population that should not be seeing these things,\u201d from myocarditis to \u201cbrain bleeds,\u201d and continues to receive similar reports in his \u201cretirement section.\u201d chambers said he developed demyelination after getting the moderna vaccine in january 2021, which led him and lt. col. theresa long, another whistleblower, to review dmed. he has more freedom to speak than long, who was supposed to testify alongside chambers until her commander gagged her from discussing dmed data the night before the hearing, long would face prosecution, jail time and dishonorable discharge for ignoring a direct order even if she later overturned the gag, according to chambers, describing long\u2019s command as \u201cvitriolic.\u201d she didn\u2019t respond to queries. chambers, long and lawyer renz joined a group letter to the federal aviation administration in december, demanding the medical \u201cflagging\u201d of all covid vaccinated pilots and their testing for heart problems. they alleged federal law prohibits commercial airline pilots who had taken emergency use authorization vaccines from flying, and imposes a 12-month observational grounding for newly approved vaccines such as pfizer\u2019s comirnaty. after vaccinated pilot robert snow suffered cardiac arrest shortly after landing an american airlines flight, anti-mandate pilots group u.s. freedom flyers accused the faa of ignoring the risk to flights from such adverse events. (full article.)\nis our military healthy enough to defend our country?\nnavy seals. image source.\nit appears to be a forgone conclusion now that our military is \u201cbeing decimated\u201d by covid-19 vaccine injuries, just as dr. chambers stated back in march, at the same time that the current administration is picking fights with russia over ukraine, and china over taiwan.\nwhat happens next? will a foreign force or perhaps a un force be able to just annex the united states and take over our government without even having to fire a shot?\nare there still enough soldiers left in our armed forces to repel a foreign invasion? are there enough local militia groups and honest law enforcement, such as constitutional sheriffs, left to defend our neighborhoods?\nwe are most certainly living through some very dark times now, and the vast majority of the public is still clueless to the real dangers we now face, and that appear to be imminent.\nwhat is currently happening in china to the people living there should be a real wake-up call to the types of measures that the globalists want to implement here.\nhttps://vaccineimpact.com/2022/dod-edits-medical-database-to-hide-military-covid-19-vaccine-injuries-as-u-s-military-is-decimated-by-the-mandatory-shots/\nsource: https://tapnewswire.com/2022/05/dod-edits-medical-database-to-hide-military-covid-19-vaccine-injuries-as-u-s-military-is-decimated-by-the-mandatory-shots/",

    "this is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\nwashington (ap) \u2014 four cadets at the air force academy may not graduate or be commissioned as military officers this month because they have refused the covid-19 vaccine, and they may be required to pay back thousands of dollars in tuition costs, according to air force officials.\nit\u2019s the only military academy, so far, where cadets may face such penalties. the army and navy said that as of now, not one of their seniors is being prevented from graduating at the u.s. military academy at west point, new york, or the naval academy in annapolis, maryland, due to vaccine refusals. the graduations are in about two weeks.\ndefense secretary lloyd austin last year made the covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members, including those at the military academies, saying the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force.\nmilitary leaders have argued that troops for decades have been required to get as many as 17 vaccines in order to maintain the health of the force, particularly those deploying overseas. students arriving at the military academies get a regimen of shots on their first day \u2014 such as measles, mumps and rubella \u2013 if they aren\u2019t already vaccinated. and they routinely get regular flu shots in the fall.\nmembers of congress, the military and the public have questioned if the exemption reviews by the military services have been fair. there have been multiple lawsuits filed against the mandate, mainly centering on the fact that very few service members have been granted religious exemptions from the shots.\nuntil the covid-19 vaccine, very few military members sought religious exemptions to any vaccines.\nlt. col. brian maguire, an air force academy spokesman, said that while vaccination status may hinder the graduation of the four seniors, \u201cthere are still two weeks until graduation, so their status could change as the cadets weigh their options.\u201d\naccording to maguire, the four cadets \u2014 who are not named \u2014 have been informed of the potential consequences, and have met with the academy\u2019s superintendent. in addition to those four, there are two juniors, one sophomore and six freshmen at the academy who have also refused the vaccine.\nthe military academies for years have required students under certain circumstances to repay tuition costs if they leave during their junior or senior year. often those involve students with disciplinary issues or similar problems. the costs can be as much as $200,000, or more, and any final decision on repayment is made by the service secretary.\nwest point said that there are no members of the class of 2022 who have refused to get the vaccine.\nacross the military, the army, navy, air force and marine corps have discharged nearly 4,000 active duty service members for refusing the vaccine. according to recent data released by the services, more than 2,100 marines, 900 sailors, 500 army soldiers and 360 airmen have been thrown out of the military, and at least 50 were discharged during entry level training, before they moved into active duty service.\nthose who flatly refuse the vaccine without seeking an exemption are still being discharged. but the courts have stalled additional discharges of service members who sought religious exemptions.\nlast month, a federal judge in texas barred the navy from taking action for now against sailors who have objected to being vaccinated on religious grounds.\nu.s. district judge reed o\u2019connor had, in january, issued a preliminary injunction preventing the navy from disciplining or discharging 35 sailors who sued over the navy\u2019s vaccine policy while their case played out. in april, o\u2019connor agreed the case could go forward as a class action suit and issued a preliminary injunction covering about 4,000 sailors who have objected on religious grounds to being vaccinated.\nalso last month, a federal judge in ohio granted a preliminary injunction blocking the air force from disciplining a dozen officers and some additional airmen and reservists who were seeking religious exemptions. the officers, mostly from wright-patterson air force base near dayton, ohio, sued in february after their exemption requests were denied.\naccording to the military, as many as 20,000 service members have asked for religious exemptions. thousands have been denied.\nas of recent data, the air force has approved 73 religious exemptions, the marine corps has approved seven, and the army has approved eight. before the injunction, the navy conditionally approved one reservist and 26 active-duty requests for religious exemptions, and 10 requests from members of the individual ready reserve. the irr approvals mean that those sailors don\u2019t have to be vaccinated until they are actually called to serve.\nabout 99% of the active duty navy and 98% of the air force, marine corps and army have gotten at least one shot.",
    "a federal judge in ohio blocked the air force\u2019s plan to expel thousands of unvaccinated service members and enforcing the vaccine requirement against covid-19 on thursday.\namerican military news reported that trump-appointed judge matthew w. mcfarland of ohio\u2019s southern district granted a temporary restraining order after service members sued the air force secretary to provide religious exemptions to the covid-19 vaccine mandate.\n\u201cmcfarland\u2019s ruling grants class status in a class action lawsuit to airmen, space force guardians, air national guardsmen and air force academy and air force reserve officer training corps (afrotc) cadets who submitted a religious accommodation request for the vaccine mandate from sept. 1, 2021, to the present, and who were confirmed by an air force chaplain as having had a sincerely held religious belief, and who either had their requests denied or still-pending accommodations,\u201d the news outlet reported.\n\u201cthe court issues a temporary restraining order prohibiting defendants from enforcing the vaccine mandate against any class member, to expire 14 days from the entry of this order,\u201d mcfarland wrote in his ruling.\njudge mcfarland ordered the defendants to write a 10-page supplemental brief by july 21, 2022, explaining why he should not extend the temporary restraining order.\nback in april, judge matthew mcfarland granted an order to block the military temporarily from disciplining 18 u.s. air force officers, airmen, and reservists, including 11 who currently or recently served at wright-patterson in dayton, until their lawsuit is resolved.\nmore from american military news:\nas of the air force\u2019s latest vaccination statistics posted tuesday, 6,803 members were denied religious accommodation requests, while 2,847 requests remain pending, and only 104 were approved. approximately 2.9% of the air force\u2019s entire ranks remain unvaccinated. the service has already kicked out 834 members. mat staver, the founder and chairman of liberty counsel \u2014 a religious freedom organization that has been supporting the air force plaintiffs in their lawsuit \u2014 said, \u201cthis is a great decision that grants protection for the religious freedom for all air force personnel from joe biden\u2019s unlawful covid shot mandate.\u201d \u201cno service member should be required to choose between service to the country and service to god. liberty counsel will be pursuing class-wide protection for the remaining branches of the military,\u201d staver added. daniel schmid, an attorney for liberty counsel, told american military news that liberty counsel is aware of service members within the lawsuit class who have begun to receive their separation packages but that no service members in the class have hit their separation dates and that the judge\u2019s order will pause those separations for now. schmid also said mcfarland\u2019s decision to grant a temporary restraining order is an indicator that the plaintiffs can expect him to grant a longer preliminary injunction soon that could last for the duration of their lawsuit against the air force.\nthe gateway pundit reported earlier this month that the united states air force began issuing its first cuts, including a highly-decorated, 19-year veteran master sergeant named nick kupper.\nin an appearance with tucker carlson on wednesday, kupper blasted biden\u2019s \u201cillegal\u201d mandates and warned that tens of thousands of other military members are facing the same fate for refusing the vaccine \u2013 unbelievably, as much as 10% of the entire us military could get the ax, according to kupper.\nwatch the video below:",
    "a federal appeals court on feb. 28 rejected an attempt by president joe biden's administration to partially lift a block on the military's covid-19 vaccine mandate for a group of navy seals.\na federal judge in january blocked the mandate's enforcement for 35 navy members, many of them seals, ruling that while the navy had provided a process for adjudicating religious exemption applications, \u201cby all accounts, it is theater.\u201d\nat the time of the ruling, the navy had granted zero religious exemptions. as of feb. 23, it had still granted none.\nnonetheless, officials asked the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit to allow the military to take into account the unvaccinated status of the 35 members when making \"deployment, assignment and other operational decisions.\" they argued that \"forcing the navy to deploy plaintiffs while they are unvaccinated threatens the success of critical missions and needlessly endangers the health and safety of other service members.\u201d\na three-judge panel on the court rejected the request , noting the discrepancy between how the branch has handled medical and religious exemption requests.\n\"the navy has granted hundreds of medical exemptions from vaccination requirements, allowing those service members to seek medical waivers and become deployable. but it has not accommodated any religious objection to any vaccine in seven years, preventing those seeking such accommodations from even being considered for medical waivers,\" the panel said.\njudges said there is apparently no template for approving requests, but there is a disapproval template form. and during the process, navy officials sent memorandums to vice admiral john nowell asking that he disapprove the exemption requests, even those based on \" sincerely held religious beliefs .\"\nthe navy has \"has effectively stacked the deck against even those exemptions supported by plaintiffs\u2019 immediate commanding officers and military chaplains,\" emphasizing the futility of pursuing exemptions, the panel said. further, letting 35 unvaccinated members deploy wouldn't seriously impede military function because over 5,000 other members are still on duty despite being unvaccinated, they added.\n\"defendants have not demonstrated 'paramount interests' that justify vaccinating these 35 plaintiffs against covid-19 in violation of their religious beliefs,\" the ruling stated.\nthe panel consisted of judges edith jones, a reagan nominee; stuart duncan, a trump nominee; and kurt engelhardt, a trump nominee.\nmike berry, director of military affairs for first liberty institute, which is representing the plaintiffs, said the group was grateful for the ruling.\n\u201cthe purge of religious servicemembers is not just devastating to morale, but it harms america\u2019s national security. it\u2019s time for our military to honor its constitutional obligations and grant religious accommodations for service members with sincere religious objections to the vaccine,\" berry said in a statement.\nthe navy declined to comment.",

    "facing the disintegration of his climate agenda as ferocious heatwaves hit large parts of the world, joe biden has unveiled a new plan to push billions of dollars to us cities and states to help them cope better with extreme heat.\nthe president stopped short, however, of declaring a climate emergency.\nbiden outlined the new actions in a speech on wednesday at a former coal plant in massachusetts, which is now part of an offshore windfarm project.\n\u201cas president, i have a responsibility to act with urgency and resolve when our nation faces clear and present danger,\u201d biden said. \u201cand that\u2019s what climate change is about. it is literally, not figuratively, a clear and present danger. the health of our citizens and our communities is literally at stake.\u201d\n02:45 joe biden unveils $2.3bn plan to tackle extreme heat \u2013 video\nthe initiatives are aimed at helping salvage the president\u2019s tattered climate agenda, which has endured a torrid month.\nlast week, joe manchin, a west virginia democratic senator who owns a coal company, appeared to rule out supporting a new clean energy bill, seemingly dooming it in the evenly split senate.\nthe blow arrived just two weeks after the conservative-dominated supreme court restricted the ability of the federal government to curb emissions from power plants.\nbiden, speaking from a lectern set up on a rock pile to an audience that included democratic legislators, said: \u201cclimate change is literally an existential threat to our nation and to the world. so my message today is this: since congress is not acting as it should - and these guys here are, but we\u2019re not getting many republican votes - this is an emergency. an emergency. and i will look at it that way.\u201d\nbiden\u2019s actions include $2.3bn in funding to help communities prepare for heatwaves, droughts and floods, new guidance that allows the federal government to help provide cooling centers and air conditioning, and new planned offshore wind energy leases for the gulf of mexico coast.\n\u201cright now, there are millions of people suffering from extreme heat at home so my team is also working with the states to deploy $385m right now. for the first time, states will be able to use federal funds to pay for air conditioners in homes, set up community cooling centres in schools where people can get through these extreme heat crises.\u201d\nthe stakes of inaction on the climate crisis have been made starkly apparent this week, with more than 100 million americans in grip of a dangerous heatwave that has pushed temperatures as high as 115f (46c) in parts of the country.\nelsewhere, disastrous wildfires have strafed france, spain and portugal, and the uk has endured its first ever recorded day of 40c heat.\nthe white house said the heatwaves showed the climate crisis is a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d to the us.\nclimate campaigners hoped biden would declare a climate state of emergency. karine jean-pierre, the white house press secretary, said that wouldn\u2019t happen on wednesday but added that the option is \u201cstill on the table\u201d.\nthe lack of such a declaration, or any sweeping ban of oil and gas drilling on public lands, is unlikely to satisfy those who have called for more vigorous action.\n\u201cbiden must declare a climate emergency, ban crude oil exports and halt new fossil fuel infrastructure, including pipelines and export terminals,\u201d said wenonah hauter, executive director of food & water watch.\n\u201cthe clock is rapidly ticking towards inevitable, irreversible climate catastrophe. there is no more time to lose.\u201d\nsome democrats have urged the president to declare a national emergency, which would allow him to block crude oil imports or direct the military to work on renewable energy production.\n\u201cfor too long we have been waiting for a single piece of legislation, and a single senate vote, to take bold action on our climate crisis,\u201d a group of senators including the leading progressives bernie sanders and elizabeth warren, wrote to biden this week.\n\u201cas a result, we urge you to put us on an emergency footing and aggressively use your executive powers to address the climate crisis.\u201d\nbut it is unclear whether such an extraordinary use of presidential powers, normally used in a military context, would survive if challenged in the rightwing-dominated supreme court, or if it would be enough to make a significant dent in planet-heating emissions.\n\u201cdeclaring a climate emergency doesn\u2019t lower any emissions,\u201d conceded sheldon whitehouse, a democratic senator from rhode island. \u201cyou have to move on to acting like it\u2019s a climate emergency, and i\u2019m looking forward to those steps.\u201d\nbiden may take further action this week by directing new regulations to cut pollution from cars, trucks and power plants.\nbut the window of opportunity to avoid disastrous climate change is rapidly closing.\nscientists have said the world must slash emissions in half this decade, and phase them out entirely by 2050, if catastrophically worse heatwaves, floods, drought and other climate impacts are to be averted. the us will fall about halfway short of such a goal absent any significant congressional action, even with presidential orders, analysts have forecast.\n\u201cpresident biden cannot do it alone,\u201d said heather zichal, chief executive of the american clean power association. \u201cwe urge congress to get back to the

    "as u.s. service members ramp up their legal challenges to military covid-19 vaccine mandates, their canadian counterparts are joining the action.\nthe justice centre for constitutional freedoms (jccf) said tuesday it had filed \"the first of many [planned] injunctions\" against the dismissal of canadian armed forces (caf) members for refusing the shots \"on the basis of health concerns, religious or conscientious objections.\"\nthe canadian civil liberties group has received \"hundreds of requests\" for help since january from active-duty members who are facing removal under the item 5(f) process, it said in a press release.\ncaf considers them \"unsuitable for further service\" because they developed \"personal weakness or behaviour\" due to factors \"wholly or chiefly ... within [their] control\" by refusing covid vaccines.\ncanada's department of national defence confirmed to canadian news organization true north in november that members of the armed forces risk removal as \"unsuitable\" unless they get an approved accommodation. caf's vaccination rate was 98.3% in january when it launched formal proceedings against more than 900 members for noncompliance, the canadian press reported.\nlegal challenges are much further along below the border. navy seals with religious objections, represented by first liberty institute, won a reprieve in january from a federal judge, who then expanded their action into a class-action suit covering the entire service in march. the navy said may 25 it has granted 28 religious accommodations.\nair force service members also represented by the christian legal defense nonprofit recently requested a \"class wide temporary restraining order\" after their religious exemptions were denied. only 68 exemptions have been approved.\njccf's first client to go to court is shannon jones, \"a healthy and skilled\" caf member who stands to lose her pension unless her injunction is approved at next week's hearing. director of communications marnie cathcart told just the news it wasn't sharing its filings \"at this time.\"\n\"this is fundamentally a patched together policy designed to punish those who do not get in line

who says he has won compensation cases for sexual assault victims and cleared the \"wrongfully accused,\" millar recently applied to join the \"hardcore litigation department\" billionaire elon musk is building at tesla. he calls himself a \"samurai for hire\" on twitter.\nmillar told just the news these were his first covid vaccine cases for service members. he has previously represented university professors put on unpaid leave on the same grounds.\nhe expects one or two injunction hearings per month and is planning to add cases on behalf of unvaccinated youth who are prevented from training in the \"army cadet\" program.\nmillar believes caf chose the \"unsuitable\" administrative removal process because a vaccine-specific rule lets members challenge their removal in court. if he can secure injunctions for clients, they can remain in the service while finishing the multiyear grievance process, millar said.\njccf kicked off the legal effort a month ago with 16 caf members, including 28-year reservist james topp, who faces court martial for \"conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline.\"\nhe posted a tik tok video in which a uniformed topp says he's on unpaid leave \"because i will not change my vaccination status,\" the cbc reported. the video did not violate a military policy on \"people in uniform making political statements\" because topp was \"speaking about a policy that directly affects him and his conviction,\" millar said.\ntopp is walking across canada to protest covid mandates and support those punished for noncompliance or coerced into compliance, chronicling his journey on tik tok for the past few months. he reached the lake superior town of marathon on monday.\nhe started his journey from vancouver on feb. 20, the same day

bail conditions, which included a ban on supporting anything \"related\" to the freedom convoy, including on social media, and travel to ontario.\na supporter sent her a pendant emblazoned with a truck image and the words \"freedom\" and \"canada\" and asked for a photo of her wearing it, which lich gave permission to post, the cbc reported.\nshe also accepted jccf's george jonas freedom award for \"spending 18 days unjustly jailed\" for leading a \"peaceful protest\" against covid mandates. the award ceremony is june 16 in toronto, but lich testified she wouldn't attend without court permission.\njustice kevin phillips agreed these actions didn't violate her bail conditions and amended them to let her travel to ontario but not downtown ottawa, which had been paralyzed by the convoy. even though he said canadian courts \"are not the thought police,\" phillips refused to lift the social media ban because that would facilitate \"toxic groupthink,\" jccf said after the

    "spread the word\nthis is great. governments cannot do anything about the virus.\nthey have no power to do so, either physically/medically, or legally. none of their mandates do anything of any value whatsoever to reduce either deaths from the virus or transmission of it and that is also true of the \u201cvaccines,\u201d which are not vaccines.\nflorida alone proves that in the united states. it has no mandates that are enforceable anywhere for anything \u2014 masks, vaccines, etc. and it has the lowest covid-case rate in the entire united states, far lower than new york or california which have the harshest mandates of all kinds. far lower than vermont or any other state where virtually 100% of the population is vaccinated with the non-vaccines.\nin fact, the more people are vaccinated \u2014 in vermont, new hampshire, maine \u2014 all those democrat-run states filled with people complying with the mandates, the higher the number of cases goes up there. most, over 50%, of the deaths in those states (over 70% in the uk ) from the virus are people who have been fully-\u201cvaccinated.\u201d but not in florida, where case numbers and deaths are dropping by double-digits every week, every month.\nand those same results are happening everywhere else in the world where the results are reported \u2014 iceland, israel, the uk \u2013 which is why our government is hiding the statistics that it knows about the effects of the \u201cvaccines\u201d in america, and the only statistics that are available for entire nations is coming from those other countries \u2013 everywhere but the us.\nthe only thing the worthless, unelected federal bureaucracies are good for is spitting out statistics from the data they force everyone to provide them. and instead of doing that, they spit out mandates that are completely baseless in science and law.\nand you won\u2019t hear a word about any of that now from the new york times, cnn, etc., facebook, twitter, the platforms that echo whatever they receive from the new york times, all of whom have been lying all along and pretending that florida has been a virtual death camp run by the \u201cevil\u201d governor desantis who refuses to impose any of those mandates on his state. they have been lying along with the federal government about every aspect of this virus and the \u201cvaccines\u201d all along.\nand the one thing they will never do is admit that they have been wrong and lying all along about everything and that governor desantis has been right. like marxists throughout the world, their own actions bring about disaster, and they always blame someone else.\nand it is child abuse and medical malpractice to even think about giving these \u201cvaccines\u201d to any child who does not have multiple comorbidities \u2014 unless his parents want it, of course. it is beyond monstrous to force children to have it forced on them by government mandate, subjecting them and their immune systems to experimental chemicals whose relatively short-term, let alone long-term, the adverse potential is completely unknown, literally turning entire populations of children into guinea pigs for no medical reason whatsoever, since their chance of dying from the virus is literally one in 2 million. yes, that is the actual statistic.\na total of 92 children, out of 48 million, have died with, not from, but with the virus this entire time in the us. and if you tell that to any true-believer democrat he/she literally won\u2019t believe you. all they have heard from joe biden and the teachers unions and the federal government bureaucrats and the fake news \u201cmedia\u201d is the terrible peril their children are in, or the terrible risk their teachers are in if they are exposed to the children, none of which is true at all.\nand it is right in the cdc\u2019s own statistics, although you have to dig deep in them to find it since they do nothing to make it clear.\nthe total number of children who have died with, not from, the virus since march 2020, is fewer children than have been shot by guns in chicago alone in 2021, fewer than the number of children struck by lightning, or dying in automobile accidents.\nand yet look at the panic they, the marxist blob, joe biden and the unelected federal government bureaucrats, and their social media and fake news propaganda organs in unison all have been and are, deliberately inciting in children and their parents about their children\u2019s supposedly, according to them, highly-likely death from the virus \u2014 deaths which statistics prove are, in fact, a virtual impossibility, not even a remote possibility under any circumstance.\nnot a single child without multiple comorbidities has died from the virus in the us or anywhere else.\nand yet they, the marxist blob have been intent on terrifying those children and their parents into obeying all their idiotic mandates, like wearing masks, and now getting the quasi-\u201cvaccines,\u201d which are obviously less effective against the virus than flu shots are against the flu, with promises of salvation from the virus and all the hysteria they themselves have engendered, salvation which never happens, because nothing they demand ever actually works, resulting in the marxist blob needing to blame someone else \u2014 again, as it always does about the terrible, real-life consequences of all its actions and its mandates, its use of force against the citizens for no purpose other than to display and rejoice in its own, completely-illegitimate power over them.\nthat is why even europeans are refusing to permit \u201cvaccines\u201d for children. and yet biden and fauci can\u2019t wait to stick it to all the kids in america and destroy people\u2019s lives if they refuse to comply with their fascist demands, demands which have no basis whatsoever in medicine nor in the constitution.\nall that mandates of any kind, mandates forbidden (because it does not specifically permit such) by the constitution to be issued by the executive branch of the federal government, do is take away peoples\u2019 freedom and destroy the countries that are subjected to them, spreading fear and panic among the population.\nthe federal government is literally powerless against the virus, powerless in every sense. and it is despicable that it, the government which has become just another cog in the marxist blob, refuses to accept, let alone admit, that very fact.\nthe pathological-liar sociopath career-bureaucrat fauci needs to be fired, his entire bureaucracy-department needs to be eliminated, all the money for research it controls needs to be returned to the treasury, and he and anyone who has been acting in concert with him need to be prosecuted, because he has known all, or most, of this all along, and he personally participated in the creation of the virus, against the orders of both presidents obama and trump, by giving us taxpayers\u2019 money to the chinese military\u2019s bio-weapons lab in wuhan doing research to create viruses like this, performing \u201cgain-of-function\u201d research, as it is euphemistically called, and he has been using all of his mandates he\u2019s been coming up with as gaslighting to divert attention from that very fact, the arsonist rushing to the fire he created to \u201csave\u201d everyone.\nand the sock-puppet marxist joe biden can\u2019t find enough mandates to impose on americans to destroy the economy, which he is actively attempting to do in every single action he takes, and turn americans against each other, and fill the nation with terror unnecessarily and with no scientific basis, about a virus which is relatively harmless to the general public, anyone who does not have multiple comorbidities. the cdc\u2019s own data proves that.\nin response

    "scarcely a day passes that we don\u2019t find out something new and objectionable about dr. rand paul. the risk in the pile-on is that a real doozie will get missed, lost in the daily torrent. the recent news\u2014his lack of standard certification as an ophthalmologist and its relationship to his self-anointing and self-created national board of ophthalmology\u2014is just such a big deal. its specifics, however, are so complicated and unrewarding to follow as to threaten to place it on the endangered scandal list.\ni am here to make certain that we don\u2019t let this one slide. his decision to sidestep the standard way doctors are certified in america is\u2014even by summer politician standards\u2014slimy, lazy, self-serving, and, important to remember as we sink deeper into his muck, revealing of the real reason for his me-against-the-man shtick. (hint: he\u2019s not looking out for you, mr. little guy). but before we read from the latest entry of the randiad, let me guide you through the mind-numbing world of american physician credentialing.\ntrying to gin up a moral issue out of the selfish power play is reminiscent of nixon\u2019s view of the law as something to try to outsmart. it\u2019s also disrespectful to the oddball but often courageous stances of his father and other giants of the right willing to fight on principle.\nhere\u2019s how it works: to practice medicine legally requires a license issued by the state. eligibility for licensure is granted after graduating medical school and after passing a series of difficult standardized exams prepared by the national board of medical examiners. once completed, licensure is forever (assuming a person behaves and isn\u2019t a total disaster). rand is a licensed physician.\nbut a guy's got to practice medicine somewhere\u2014an eye specialist like dr. paul, for example, needs a hospital's operating rooms to ply his trade. and that's where certification comes in. whereas licensure is a one-size-fits-all blanket of general adequacy, certification is granted by a specialty board to indicate competency in a specific field such as ophthalmology (or medicine or surgery or psychiatry). certification tests long have been administered by venerable, apolitical groups such as the american board of ophthalmology (or internal medicine or whatever). the certificate is a national credential that, although not absolutely necessary to practice medicine, is more or less required for any doctor seeking an affiliation with a hospital.\nit gets even more complicated, but hang in there; rand is hoping the distinctions are just too subtle for anyone to really care about. in the 1980s, american medicine decided that it should police itself. a little. so the grand old men of the various fields decided that already certified specialists should recertify once a decade. rand initially did the right thing and became certified; but when his 10 years were up, he decided he\u2019d had enough and chose not to recertify. rather, he organized his own certifying program for ophthalmology based right there in his hometown of bowling green. he then appointed himself president of the group, which he named the national board of ophthalmologists, and better yet, declared his wife (not a doctor) vp and his father-in-law secretary. talk about convenient! it remains unclear what the nbo criteria for certification are; the organization appears to have no website or easily located documents (though it is registered with the state of kentucky as a nonprofit and claims to have certified a few hundred eye doctors).\nall of this would be ok with me; i just took the frigging recertification test in my field and i hated every minute of it. it is humiliating and infuriating and insulting and a waste of time and money. indeed, i applaud rand\u2019s sticking his tongue out at the gasbags who insist on teenage procedures (multiple-choice tests proctored now by cybersecurity) to assure that a doctor is certified in his field.\nbut rand lost me when he articulated the reason why he resisted. being a conscientious objector or pissed off adult simply wasn\u2019t good enough. no, he decided to cast it as a high-end moral stance against groups that discriminate\u2014groups like the american board of ophthalmology. and what exactly was their discriminatory practice? opposing civil rights maybe? nope\u2014much, much worse. the old geezers who made up the test requirements built a nice little loophole for themselves: they excluded themselves from having to recertify\u2014instead they were \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in. and in so doing they discriminated against poor rand and me and thousands of other of victimized doctors. thank goodness someone had the strength to make a stand against the nefarious two-tiered system. ah the pure horseshit\u2014true kentucky thoroughbred stuff.\ntrying to gin up a moral issue out of the selfish power play is reminiscent of nixon\u2019s view of the law as something to try to outsmart. it\u2019s also disrespectful to the oddball but often courageous stances of his father and other giants of the right willing to fight on principle. with his creation of a ludicrous home-brew \u201ccertifying board,\u201d he has shown his dedication not to a movement but to the single goal of making life a little bit more convenient for rand paul. and here paul does appear to speak for his generation: he has given us the finest example yet of yuppie selfishness in senescence.\ncorrection: an earlier version of this story incorrectly said that the national board of medical examiners was roughly the equivalent of the american bar association.\nkent sepkowitz is an infectious-disease specialist in new york city. he has contributed to the new york times, slate, and, oh-so-briefly, o magazine. he also writes academic medical articles that are at times pretty tough sledding.",

    "at this moment, the united states navy is preparing to deploy a 10,000-ton warship carrying 320 officers and sailors, along with missiles, torpedoes, and a mounted artillery gun. this ship, known as a guided-missile destroyer, defends the united states and its allies on the seas. although its next mission remains secret, it may bolster american military presence in europe as russian aggression pushes the continent into war. but the navy cannot currently deploy this warship, because it has lost trust in its commanding officer, an anti-vaxxer who has repeatedly disobeyed lawful orders, misled superiors, and allegedly exposed dozens of his crew to covid-19 due to a refusal to get tested.\nthe navy wants to remove this officer, whom i\u2019ll call john doe, from command of the destroyer. but it can\u2019t, because a single federal judge in tampa has forbidden it. this judge has overruled multiple admirals and captains who assert, under oath, that deploying the ship with doe in charge would imperil national security. he instead ordered the navy, under threat of sanction, to keep this disobedient officer in charge of a $1.8 billion warship. the federal judiciary is quite literally preventing the nation from defending itself at sea.\nadvertisement\nthat judge, steven douglas merryday, is a george h.w. bush nominee who sits on a federal trial court in florida. he gained notoriety in 2021 after blocking a cdc order that limited cruise ship operations due to the pandemic. so, when the far-right liberty counsel sought to halt president joe biden\u2019s covid-19 vaccine mandate for the armed forces, they took their case to merryday\u2019s court. predictably, they prevailed: in february, merryday ruled that the mandate violated the religious freedom restoration act, siding with the plaintiffs, navy commander john doe and lieutenant colonel jane smith. (i\u2019ve applied these pseudonyms to the officers because the court granted them anonymity.)\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nbut merryday did not merely exempt doe and smith from the mandate. rather, he handed down a sweeping restraining order that prohibited the navy from taking any \u201cadverse action\u201d against the plaintiffs because of their unvaccinated status. specifically, he barred the navy from reassigning them for any reason whatsoever.\nthis order created immediate problems. an active-duty member of the marine corps, smith is slated to take command of a combat logistics battalion later this year. as lieutenant general w.m. jurney attested, this commander must disembark at ally nations all over the world. many of these countries require all u.s. service members to be vaccinated against covid before stepping on their shores. because she is unvaccinated, smith is not \u201cworldwide deployable,\u201d in jurney\u2019s words. and yet merryday has forced the navy to deploy her.\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nbut doe poses the bigger threat. he is currently the commanding officer of a warship that may soon set sail. if he falls seriously ill at sea\u2014which is more likely because he refuses the vaccine\u2014he may thwart the entire mission. the issue, however, goes deeper than that. in declarations, vice admiral d.w. dwyer and captain frank brandon explained that doe\u2019s anti-vax beliefs are part of a broader pattern of insubordination. brandon testified that last november, he spoke with doe on doe\u2019s ship one day before its scheduled departure. doe was experiencing multiple symptoms of covid, and appeared to have a relatively severe case; he could, brandon recalled, \u201cbarely speak.\u201d yet doe refused to get tested\u2014a clear violation of protocol\u2014and attended a briefing in a cramped room with about 60 other people. brandon ordered doe to get a test, which revealed that he did, indeed, have covid, and exposed dozens of others to the virus.\nadvertisement\ndoe engaged in other deceptive behavior. for instance, when requesting leave, he concealed the fact that he was flying to another state, which would have triggered a mandatory risk assessment. after brandon discovered this subterfuge, he learned that doe had traveled to a high-risk area, requiring five days\u2019 quarantine upon return. doe did not inform his executive officer of this extended absence, creating a \u201csignificant and very rare\u201d disruption \u201cacross the waterfront\u201d during a crucial phase of ship preparation. brandon concluded that doe \u201cintentionally deceived me,\u201d \u201cput his crew at risk,\u201d \u201cfailed to comply with the navy\u2019s covid-19 policies,\u201d and engaged in \u201cnegligent behavior\u201d in \u201cperformance of his duties.\u201d\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\n\u201ci do not trust [doe] with the lives of our sailors,\u201d brandon testified. he continued:\nadvertisement\ni am responsible for the well-being of my squadron, including welfare of my ships and the health of my sailors. my loss of confidence in [doe] is \u2026 based on the fact that i cannot trust his judgment, i cannot trust him to look after the welfare of his sailors, and i cannot trust him to be honest with me. in my judgment, allowing him to remain in command of a navy warship would be reckless.\nbrandon\u2019s view is shared across the navy. in dwyer\u2019s alarming declaration, the vice admiral explained that doe would constitute a \u201cmanifest national security concern\u201d if he remains a commanding officer. \u201cit is untenable that a subordinate commander may choose to disregard, modify, or half-heartedly execute a senior officer\u2019s orders due to his or her personal beliefs,\u201d dwyer testified. this insubordination \u201cdegrades mission effectiveness and the ability of the strike group to perform its mission in the interest of u.s. national security.\u201d\nadvertisement\nmerryday\u2019s order, dwyer noted, \u201crequires the navy to leave a subordinate commander in command of a warship, despite his senior officer\u2019s questions relating to his fitness to discharge his duties as ordered. under no circumstances would the navy typically deploy a commander in an operational capacity with whom his or her superior officers have such reservations.\u201d\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nin light of these fears, the department of justice pleaded with merryday to pause his decision. on wednesday, he declined. merryday scorned the notion that doe might get sick, writing that he is \u201ctriumphantly fit and slim and strong.\u201d he also implied that navy leadership may be lying about doe\u2019s insubordination in retaliation against his religious beliefs. merryday declined to fully credit their testimony until he could subject them to cross-examination. he concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to religious liberty trumps the navy\u2019s profound national security concerns.\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nthe navy and the federal judiciary are therefore in a standoff. the navy will not deploy doe\u2019s warship until he is stripped of command. merryday will not allow it to do so. as a result, merryday has effectively taken a 10,000 ton, $1.8 billion guided-missile destroyer out of commission. as the navy builds up its naval presence in europe to guard against further russian aggression, it is down a ship\u2014solely because an unelected judge in tampa has inserted himself into the chain of command.\nthis situation is untenable. already, a texas judge, abetted by the 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals, has freed nearly three dozen seals from the vaccine mandate, a decision that high-ranking officers say will put the world at risk. now merryday is holding back a warship from deployment\u2014and the judicial resistance to military mandate is just beginning. these cases are on a fast-track to the supreme court. if the justices do not confirm that judges must respect the commander-in-chief\u2019s lawful orders, thousands of other service members like doe will unleash chaos on the armed forces.",

    "the u.s. army is hemorrhaging people.\nthe army\u2019s vice chief of staff, gen. joseph m. martin, confirmed at a house armed services subcommittee on readiness hearing on tuesday that the regular army is poised to fall nearly 19,000 soldiers short of its staffing target, or end strength, in fiscal 2022.\nlooking ahead to fiscal 2023, martin essentially said the service will be lucky to fall only 18,000 short of its goal.\nshortfalls in recruiting and retaining national guard and army reserve personnel were not specified at the hearing. but similar shortfalls in hitting a target of 525,000 army reservists would come on top of the missing regular army soldiers.\n\u201cthat\u2019s alarming,\u201d said rep. jackie speier, who chairs the house armed services subcommittee on personnel, referring to the end strength shortfalls at tuesday\u2019s hearing.\non top of those gaps, the army may soon discharge another 20,000 soldiers, in both the regular and reservist forces, who have refused to get the coronavirus vaccine. army secretary christine wormuth has yet to announce a decision on those cases.\nif all these numbers hold, the army could fall short of its goals by almost 57,000 over this year and the next, based on people who either leave, are fired or don\u2019t join the service. and that\u2019s not including possible shortfalls in the national guard and reserve.\nthe reasons abound behind the shrinking pool of those willing and able to join the army and to stay in it. the factors range from a challenging post-pandemic recruiting environment to signs of declining morale among those currently in the service to a population of potential recruits that has shrunk due to factors such as obesity and lack of education.\nend strength a weakness?\nfor fiscal 2022, the regular army\u2019s end strength objective is set at 485,000. but martin testified tuesday that the service expects to land at 466,400 soldiers instead, a shortfall of 18,600.\nfor fiscal 2023, the end strength target for the regular army is lower: 473,000. but the service believes now it could fall 18,000 short of that goal.\nat the same time, the service may have to let go 20,000 soldiers who have refused to be vaccinated without receiving an exemption \u2014 about 9,000 in the regular army and 11,000 in the national guard and army reserve.\nall told, those estimates

soldiers in fiscal 2023, the army expects the figure to be between 445,000 and 452,000.\nmartin confirmed the numbers and said the army is aiming to get to 455,000, but he added: \u201cthe question is whether we can achieve it.\u201d\nif the army achieves the 455,000 goal \u2014 and that is far from certain \u2014 the service would still be 18,000 below its desired total.\nmartin said the service faces an \u201cunprecedented challenge\u201d in recruiting due to what he called \u201ca post-covid environment and labor market\u201d and with many private companies offering potential employees lucrative incentives.\nhe said the percentage of the overall population of age to serve that is deemed physically and mentally capable of doing so has shrunk from 29 percent to 23 percent (he didn\u2019t say in what time frame).\nwithin that 23 percent, a smaller number have a propensity to serve, he added.\nthere is growing evidence that those in the military are less and less inclined to remain there. last week, the military family advisory network released a survey of more than 8,000 military family members. the percentage that said they would recommend military life had dropped \u2014 from 74.5 percent in 2019 to 62.9 percent in 2021.\nthe respondents cited strains on family life stemming from factors such as frequent changes of station. the survey also showed that 1 in 6 military families has trouble feeding its members \u2014 a problem that pre-dated both the pandemic and the recent surge of inflation but that has not gone away.\nspeier cited another issue that may reduce the desire of those currently serving to stay in the military: 19,000 military families, she said, are waiting to receive child care.\n\u201cmr. chairman, we might need to have a subsequent hearing on this because it\u2019s pretty serious,\u201d speier said to rep. john garamendi, the california democrat who chairs the readiness panel. \u201cif we need to make some changes to be able to attract more talent, then we need to look more carefully at that.\u201d\n\u2018good order and discipline\u2019\nas for soldiers refusing to be vaccinated, martin said that a widely circulating estimate of 60,000 soldiers poised to leave the force is not accurate. he said the number is \u201cless than 20,000 \u2014 but it\u2019s still a significant number.\u201d\nmartin added that the army is working hard to convince vaccine skeptics or provide exemptions for medical or religious reasons.\nrepublicans, in particular, have been up in arms about the prospect of losing so many servicemembers over the issue.\n\u201cevery effort should be made to provide for exemptions so we can retain the servicemembers we have,\u201d said joe wilson of south carolina, the full committee\u2019s second most senior republican.\nmichael waltz of florida, the top republican on the readiness panel and a former army special forces officer, said he supports \u201cgood order and discipline\u201d in the military and understands that \u201can order\u2019s an order.\u201d\nbut, he said, leaders need to \u201cconstantly evaluate the costs and risks of our orders.\u201d he said vaccines have changed from a potential threat to unit readiness to more of a personal health decision, since the shots do not have the protective capacity they once did, given that they guard more against getting severe symptoms than against contracting covid-19.",

sars-cov-2/covid-19 when no vaccines were available), and 2021 (the year that vaccines were available and mandated for the us military). as noted above, there are many potential confounding variables, but whatever the cause, if these data are not due to longstanding and previously undiscovered \u201cdata corruption\u201d, then we have a major issue with the overall health of our armed services. and if they are due to previously undiscovered \u201cdata corruption\u201d, why wasn\u2019t someone running around with their pants on fire trying to figure out what is going on here long before the whistleblowers brought this to national attention?\na u.s. federal district court judge in early february halted the department of defense\u2019s rejection of soldiers\u2019 exemption requests on

certainly has not established, that permitting the relatively small number of rfra objectors, even if every request for exemption (much less the two at issue in this motion) were sincere and

contractors.\nthe lawmakers also are asking to re-instate those who\u2019ve already been discharged for noncompliance.\nin a sept. 15 letter to defense secretary lloyd austin, the lawmakers wrote \u201cto express our grave concern over the effect of the department of defense\u2019s covid-19 vaccine mandate on the readiness of our armed forces, particularly the u.s. army.\n\u201cas a result of your mandate, eight percent of the army\u2019s approximately 1 million soldiers face expulsion, army recruiters cannot meet their fy22 target, and the army has cut its projected fy23 end strength by 12,000 soldiers. as a major land war rages in europe, our own military faces a self-imposed readiness crisis.\u201d\nthe letter was co-led by republican reps. mike johnson of louisiana, chip roy of texas and thomas massie of kentucky.\n\u201cthe opaqueness of the department continues to frustrate members of congress attempting to perform oversight of the executive branch,\u201d they write, adding, \u201cour repeated inquiries remain unanswered.\n\u201cwe are not the only ones frustrated. thousands of these service members have been left in limbo while they wait for the adjudication of religious and medical exemptions. some have waited for nearly a year to learn if they will be forcibly discharged for their sincerely held religious beliefs or medical concerns.\u201d\nthey also asked if 75,000 soldiers are discharged how the army will replace them since by the \u201cvery end of the fiscal year, the army has only met 52% of its fy22 recruiting goal.\u201d\nthey also point out serious problems with the army\u2019s existing recruitment strategy.\n\u201cearlier this summer, the service began accepting enlistees without high school degrees or geds, offering $35,000 to any enlistee willing to go to basic training within 45 days, removing tattoo policies, and allowing soldiers to pick their first duty station,\u201d they write. \u201cwe are not at war, but the army is reducing basic standards and offering enlistment incentives greater than or equal to those during the height of the war on terror \u2013 with poorer results.\u201d\naccording to cdc data, over 40% of american men between the ages of 18 and 24 refuse to take the covid-19 vaccine. that number is over 50% in the south, a region where more than half of all those enlisting in the u.s. military live.\naustin\u2019s mandate, the members of congress argue, automatically \u201cdisqualifies more than forty percent of the army\u2019s target demographic from service nationwide, and over half of the individuals in the most fertile recruiting grounds.\u201d\naustin maintains that the mandate is imperative for mission readiness and the department has steadfastly defended it in lawsuits filed against it. those representing the branches of the military sued have argued federal district judges don\u2019t have jurisdiction to rule on military cases, which they\u2019ve lost. they fought against federal judges granting class action status, which they also lost in cases in which judges issued stinging rebukes of military policies.\nthe members of congress argue, \u201cincreasing amounts of data raise legitimate questions\u201d about the mandate. service members under 40 without comorbidities have nearly no chance of dying from the coronavirus, they argue, and \u201cstudy after study has shown that covid vaccinations have negligible or even negative efficacy against the omicron strains. we also know that natural immunity provides better protection against infection and death than existing covid vaccines, yet the department still refuses to recognize it in lieu of vaccination.\u201d\nthe legislators also requested information from austin about how many military members have been vaccinated, how many filed religious, medical and administrative exemption requests, and how many requests were granted. they also asked how much it will cost to recruit, train and find replacements for those facing expulsion.\nthey conclude, \u201cthe data is now clear. the department of defense\u2019s covid vaccine mandate is deleterious to readiness and the military\u2019s ability to fight and win wars. the vaccine provides negligible benefit to the young, fit members of our armed forces, and the mandate\u2019s imposition is clearly affecting the department\u2019s ability to sustain combat formations and recruit future talent. we urge you to immediately revoke your covid-19 vaccine mandate for all service members, civilian personnel, and contractors and re-instate those who have already been discharged.\u201d\nsince august 24, 2021, the department \u201chas unlawfully administered emergency use authorized products as if they were fully licensed fda approved products and military members have not been allowed to exercise their legal right to refuse them,\u201d liberty counsel, which represents members of the u.s. military in lawsuits against the administration, argues.\nit\u2019s also reported examples of military members whose religious exemption requests have been denied and have faced \u201ccruel and unusual punishment.\u201d\nits founder

    "from yesterday's decision by judge steven merryday (m.d. fla.) in navy seal 1 v. biden, following up on an earlier decision:\non january 20, 2022, the plaintiffs moved to amend the complaint. on january 21, 2022, the plaintiffs\u2014in accord with the november 22 order\u2014submit[ted] a supplemental memorandum in support of a preliminary injunction\u2026. at 6:18 p.m. on february 1, 2022, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order on behalf of two service members allegedly confronting imminent removal from a position of command\u2026.\n[my] november 22, 2021 order denies a preliminary injunction for the non-service members, defers resolving the motion on behalf of the service members, and requires the defendants to submit on january 7, 2022, a notice containing for each branch of the armed forces information about, among other things, the number of pending requests for religious and other exemptions and the number of requests denied after final appeal\u2026.\nharboring a religious objection to the covid-19 vaccine, service members of each branch of the military, federal employees, federal contractors, and employees of federal contractors, sued on behalf of a putative class and promptly moved to temporarily restrain and to preliminarily enjoin military directives and executive orders requiring covid-19 vaccination but allowing requests for religious and other exemptions\u2026. an october 18, 2021 scheduling order (doc. 9) observes that a temporary restraining order directed to the putative class will likely not issue, but the october 18 order states that the plaintiffs may move on behalf of an individual service member subject to a circumstance markedly more acute than the other members of the putative class\u2026.\nnavy commander serves as the commanding officer of a guided missile destroyer in the navy. navy commander joined the navy in 2004 and has served for more than seventeen years\u2026. on january 28, 2022, the chief of naval operations, the ultimate appellate authority within the navy, denied navy commander's appeal [of the rejection of a religious exemption].\nthe appellate denial letter assumes that navy commander's \"religious beliefs are sincere and would be substantially burdened.\" however, the letter states, among other things, that \"[a] waiver of immunizations would have a predictable and detrimental effect on the readiness of you and the sailors who serve along side you\" and that the other preventative measures, which for the last two years navy commander has required of the sailors under his command, \"are not 100 percent effective and must be implemented in conjunction with immunization to reduce the risk of mission failure.\" the letter declines to mention that the navy has granted 270 medical exemptions and fails to explain the unsuitability of the alternative precautions afforded the recipients of a medical exemption\u2026.\nlieutenant colonel 2 serves as a logistics officer at marine forces special operations command at camp lejeune, north carolina. lieutenant colonel enlisted in the marine corps in 1997\u2026. before joining the military, lieutenant colonel 2 received an abortion after becoming pregnant from rape. this experience caused lieutenant colonel 2 to develop strong religious opposition to abortion and to any vaccine developed with fetal cell lines. in the denial letter [as to lieutenant colonel 2's appeal of the denial of her religious exemption], \u2026 the assistant commandant questions whether receiving the covid-19 vaccine substantially burdens a religious belief because lieutenant colonel 2's objections to the covid-19 vaccine \"could be made for every fda approved vaccine [she has] received\" in the military. further, \"assuming that covid-19 vaccination substantially burdens\" a religious belief, the assistant commandant concludes that \"the government's compelling interests in military readiness and in the health and safety of the force\" justifies denying lieutenant colonel 2's request. the denial letter declines to mention that the marines have granted 234 medical exemptions and fails to explain the unsuitability of the alternative precautions afforded a recipient of a medical exemption\u2026.\nthe order deferring the motion for a preliminary injunction contemplated that some exigent circumstance might require more narrow and interim relief to preserve, pending the outcome of pending matters, the rights of a service member otherwise subject to some adverse action by the military because of the military's denying, allegedly in violation of rfra, a service member's request for a religious exemption\u2026.\nthe record as a whole in this action and the attendant circumstances support the motion by the two service member plaintiffs, and the motion is granted-in-part for the following reasons and to the following extent. the purpose of this relief is preservation of the status quo for a week to permit a reasonable and practical opportunity for a hearing and any necessary and additional submissions from the parties. the hearing on further preliminary relief as a result of the pending motion will occur on february 10, 2022 \u2026.\nthe record in this action establishes that the two service members are very likely to prevail on their claim that their respective branch of the military has wrongfully denied a religious exemption from covid-19 vaccination. the record creates a strong inference that the services are discriminatorily and systematically denying religious exemptions without a meaningful and fair hearing and without the showing required under rfra (while simultaneously granting medical exemptions and permitting unvaccinated persons to continue in service without adverse consequence).\none struggles to imagine a wholesome and lawful explanation for the results evidenced in this record. the military is well aware of the frailty of their arguments in defense of their practices. those arguments both procedural and substantive, are rejected in an action that is distinctively parallel to this action. u.s. navy seals 1\u201326, et\nal v. biden (n.d. tex. jan. 3, 2022) (characterizing the military's review of requests for a religious exemption as \"theater\" and granting relief to the service member plaintiffs). rejection on the same or a more encompassing basis is likely in this action (especially if the conduct of the military continues along the present lines).\nthe two moving service members face either (1) a most-likely-unlawful deprivation of their accumulated status and standing in the united states military, as well as prospective advancement and benefits, or (2) deprivation of their constitutional and statutory rights to free exercise and the statutory right to receive a religious exemption unless the military can meet the statutory burden of proof, which the military has not and likely cannot. on the other hand, the military faces a trivial, if any, prospect of material injury as a result of permitting the service members continued service under the same terms and conditions and with the same privileges and emoluments as currently prevail, especially because the military permits a large group of unvaccinated persons to serve without adverse consequence.\nfinally, the military is most likely unable to establish, and certainly has not established, that permitting the relatively small number of rfra objectors, even if every request for exemption (much less the two at issue in this motion) were sincere and successful, to serve without adverse consequences to their standing and the terms and conditions of their service will adversely affect the public's interest in the maintenance and readiness of the nation's military forces. in fact, the public undoubtedly has some considerable interest in maintaining the services of skilled, experienced, highly trained, patriotic, courageous, and esteemed service members, such as the two moving service members, in whom the public has an immense financial investment and who are not, to say the least, readily replaceable.\nthe secretary of defense and anyone acting in concert with him, as specified in and to the full extent of rule 65, federal rules of civil procedure, is enjoined through february 11, 2022, from diminishing or altering in any manner and for any reason the current status of navy commander and lieutenant colonel 2, including their assignment, privileges, rank, or the like. in short, navy commander and lieutenant colonel 2 must remain \"as is\" throughout the duration of this injunctive relief\u2026.",

    "dr. theresa long, a us military medical officer, stated in court that she was told by a superior to conceal covid-19 vaccination injuries as part of the biden administration\u2019s directive.\nthe department of defense dismissed dr. long\u2019s findings, claiming that the spike in vaccination injuries was due to a \u201cdatabase malfunction.\u201d\nliberty counsel, the law firm representing thirty members of the military who are fighting the military vaccine mandate, returned to federal court on march 10 to defend the preliminary injunction granted to two military plaintiffs by judge steven merryday, allowing them to avoid the military vaccine mandate.\nwhile the case was on appeal, the department of defense (dod) petitioned the judge to set aside the injunction.\njudge merryday is a united states district judge for the middle district of florida of the united states district court.\nper dailyexpose: during the all-day hearing, liberty counsel presented compelling testimony from the navy commander of a surface warship and three military flight surgeons, lt. col. peter chambers, lt. col. teresa long and col. (ret.) stewart tankersley, m.d. in contrast, the dod declined to present witnesses.\nfounder and chairman of liberty counsel mat staver said in an interview with the blaze\u2019s daniel horowitz on monday that there have been three hearings now in this case, and the dod has not yet offered a single witness. instead of witnesses, the government \u201csends these declarations,\u201d staver explained. he said the judge has urged them to bring live witnesses to court so they can be cross examined, but they just refuse to do it. \u201cso they send these declarations that some jag attorney writes, and somebody in the military signs off on them.\u201d\nstaver said that the information the dod has been presenting in court is \u201coutdated, wrong, and would really be subject to dismantling under cross examination.\u201d he added that cross examinations of his witnesses have only made their case stronger. \u201cso they really don\u2019t have anything to cross examine our witnesses with,\u201d he said.\nstaver told horowitz that judge merryday has chastised the dod lawyers during the hearings, telling them they have \u201ca frail case,\u201d and are \u201cacting as though they are above the law.\u201d\ndr. theresa long, a flight surgeon who holds a master\u2019s degree in public health and is specially trained in the dmed, gave emotional testimony on march 10.\nshe and two other flight surgeons reviewed dmed last year and made some stunning discoveries about the high incidence of apparent vaccine injuries among members of the military.\naccording to the whistleblowers, certain disorders spiked after the vaccine mandate went into effect, including miscarriages and cancers, and neurological problems which increased by 1000 percent.\ndr. long testified that she was contacted by high level officer the night before the hearing, and told not to discuss her findings regarding the explosive military medical data in court. the whistleblower reportedly said she felt threatened after she tried to get her superiors to address the findings, \u201cfearing for her life and for the safety of her children.\u201d\nsince the whistleblowers came forward with the dmed data, the dod has thrown cold water on their conclusions, saying the increase in vaccine injuries was caused by a \u201cglitch in the database.\u201d\npolitifact contacted peter graves, spokesperson for the defense health agency\u2019s armed forces surveillance division, who said the data for 2021 is correct, but for some reason, the data for the five years prior was inaccurate. graves told politifact by email that the division reviewed data in the dmed \u201cand found that the data was incorrect for the years 2016-2020.\u201d\nin other words, for five straight years, the data was seriously corrupted and none of the dod\u2019s data analysts figured this out, and then it fixed itself on its own in 2021. the dod has since put out new numbers showing more illnesses among the troops for the years prior to 2021.\nstaver asked long a question about the dmed data during the hearing, and she answered: \u201ci have been ordered not to answer that question.\u201d\njudge merryday reportedly asked long: \u201cordered by who?,\u201d and the doctor explained what happened the night before the hearing.\nstaver then asked long if the information the military ordered her to withhold was relevant and helpful for the court and the public to know. she said, \u201cyes,\u201d and staver asked her why.\nlong reportedly paused and choked back tears as she told the judge: \u201ci have so many soldiers being destroyed by this vaccine. not a single member of my senior command has discussed my concerns with me \u2026 i have nothing to gain and everything to lose by talking about it. i\u2019m ok with that because i am watching people get absolutely destroyed.\u201d\ndr. long also testified that the data shows that deaths of military members from the vaccines exceed deaths from covid itself.\nstaver later told horowitz that the dod\u2019s order for her not to discuss dmed amounted to witness tampering, especially since long has whistleblower protections.\n\u201cthey not only violated the whistleblower act, they potentially intimidated a witness and tried to change that witness\u2019 testimony,\u201d he said during the conservative review podcast on monday.\nthe doctor said she is constantly contacted by people who have been injured by the genetic vaccines, and that many of those injured are pilots, who are expected to meet high fitness standards. long told staver that in just one afternoon she heard from four pilots who had just gotten mris back showing that they had myocarditis.\nmorale is tanking in the military, she testified, with soldiers are in despair over the pressure to get the vaccine, and some are even having suicidal thoughts.\nlong said she was aware of at least two people who have committed suicide over the pressure, and the threat of punishment for refusal.\nshe said the current regime\u2019s policies are undermining \u201cgood order and discipline.\u201d\nin addition to dr. long, an unnamed navy commander testified about his commander\u2019s attempts to punish him for refusing the experimental injections.\non february 2, judge merryday issued a temporary restraining order blocking the navy from punishing the commander because of his vaccination status. judge merryday ruled the navy violated the federal religious freedom restoration act (rfra).\nwhen the court ordered the commodore to comply with the law, he filed an affidavit saying he had \u201clost confidence\u201d in the commander because the commander had not taken the covid shots.\nthe judge then entered a preliminary injunction, and the dod and the navy filed a motion asking the court to set aside his injunction, arguing that due to their \u201clost confidence\u201d in the commander, his ship could not deploy.\nhowever, at the time the ship was allegedly unable to be deployed, the commander was actually far out to sea testing the ship and training the crew.\nwhile many commanders fail to complete these operations timely, the commander completed the mission early and the ship deemed \u201csafe and ready.\u201d\nin a dramatic moment, the commander said he should not have to be there in court defending religious freedom. \u201cgenerals and admirals should be here saying what i am saying today to uphold religious freedom. our religious freedoms are being attacked.\u201d\nalso testifying last week was dr. pete chambers, a purple heart recipient who is in the texas national guard defending the southern border where 10,000-20,000 illegal immigrants are flooding through every week. \u201cmy job is to keep our soldiers safe,\u201d chambers said.\nchambers was hoping to retire from the military in 2023 after nearly 40 years of service, but his adverse reaction to the moderna shot derailed his plans.\ntrusting the military that the shots are \u201csafe and effective,\u201d and not knowing at the time that aborted fetal cells were used in the testing and/or development, he took the shot. he now suffers from demyelination, a condition affecting the central nervous system caused by the injection.\nafter his moderna injury, dr. chambers met lt. col. long. they reviewed the dod\u2019s defense medical epidemiology database (dmed), the military equivalent to the federal government\u2019s vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers), where he discovered other military members also developed a demyelination disease after the covid shots.\nchambers, a military flight surgeon and one of only six green beret surgeons, was told that his job was to get soldiers to vaccinated. his superiors told him that religious exemptions would be automatically denied. \u201csoldiers will try. soldiers will fail,\u201d this commanders said.\nhe pointed out that shots are not effective in preventing infection, and estimated that about 75-80% of soldiers getting infected are \u201cdouble vaxxed\u201d compared to only about 15% of soldiers who are not vaccinated.\nlike long, chambers also testified that many soldiers are being injured by the covid shots, and that \u201cthis is not normal.\u201d\ndr. stewart tankersley, a flight surgeon who retired in september 2021 at the rank of colonel, testified that the injections are neither safe nor effective.\ntankersley said he has personally treated over 200 covid patients with no fatalities, and the group of doctors with whom he is associated has treated over 18,000 covid patients with deaths only in the single digits.\n\u201ci\u2019ve never seen anything like this in the military or civilian world, the lack of dialogue, the suppression of scientific dialogue.\u201d tankersley said on the stand.\ndr. tankersley explained one of several reasons there are so many injuries from the covid shots. the mrna vaccines require a lipid nanoparticle (lnp) as a delivery mechanism because the rna quickly degrades without being encased in the lnp. the combination bypasses the natural immune system and creates inflammation that can inhibit the body\u2019s innate immunity.\ndr. tankersley testified that the shots are neither safe nor effective. he also testified that there are safe and effective treatments for covid, including nasal rinsing and ivermectin.\nliberty counsel argued that the dod\u2019s position that the only one way to combat covid and ensure military readiness is to force the injections and kick out the unvaccinated is \u201cuntenable,\u201d and that the mandate is undermining military readiness and harming morale.\nstaver said: \u201ci am honored to serve the brave men and women of the military. i am dismayed by the abuse and propaganda forced upon them from the white house and the department of defense. the truth will prevail, and freedom will win.\u201d",

    "st, petersburg, florida (cnn) florida gov. ron desantis wants to reestablish a world war ii-era civilian military force that he, not the pentagon, would control.\ndesantis pitched the idea thursday as a way to further support the florida national guard during emergencies, like hurricanes. the florida national guard has also played a vital role during the pandemic in administering covid-19 tests and distributing vaccines.\nbut in a nod to the growing tension between republican states and the biden administration over the national guard, desantis also said this unit, called the florida state guard, would be \"not encumbered by the federal government.\" he said this force would give him \"the flexibility and the ability needed to respond to events in our state in the most effective way possible.\" desantis is proposing bringing it back with a volunteer force of 200 civilians, and he is seeking $3.5 million from the state legislature in startup costs to train and equip them.\nsee more\nstates have the power to create defense forces separate from the national guard, though not all of them use it. if florida moves ahead with desantis' plan to reestablish the civilian force, it would become the 23rd active state guard in the country, desantis' office said in a press release, joining california, texas and new york. these guards are little-known auxiliary forces with origins dating back to the advent of state militias in the 18th century. while states and the department of defense share control of the national guard, state guards are solely in the power of a governor.\nthe proposal from desantis comes on the heels of defense secretary lloyd austin's directive warning that national guard members who refuse to get vaccinated against the coronavirus will have their pay withheld and barred from training. oklahoma gov. kevin stitt, a republican, had requested an exemption for guard members in his state, which austin denied.\ndemocrats in florida immediately expressed alarm at desantis' announcement. us rep. charlie crist, who is running as a democrat to challenge the governor in 2022, tweeted, \"no governor should have his own handpicked secret police.\"\nstate sen. annette taddeo, another gubernatorial candidate, wrote on twitter that desantis was a \"wannabe dictator trying to make his move for his own vigilante militia like we've seen in cuba.\"\nthe florida state guard was created in 1941 during world war ii as a temporary force to fill the void left behind when the florida national guard was deployed to assist in the us combat efforts. it was disbanded after the war ended, but the authority for a governor to establish a state defense force remained.\n\"reestablishing the florida state guard will allow civilians from all over the state to be trained in the best emergency response techniques and have the ability to mobilize very, very quickly,\" desantis said during a visit to pensacola on thursday.\nstate guards are typically deployed to respond during a disaster, though governors have found other reasons to call them into action.\nin 2015, republican gov. greg abbott used the texas state guard to monitor federal military exercises in his state, responding to what was at the time a fast-growing conspiracy theory that the federal government was using walmart parking lots to prepare for a future state of martial law. abbott said the guards were just collecting information to keep texans safe during the multi-week exercises.\nflorida law authorizes the governor to maintain a defense force as \"necessary to assist the civil authorities in maintaining law and order,\" meaning desantis would have another force to respond to unrest that may erupt in the future. desantis swiftly deployed the florida national guard to major cities after protests and violence broke out in response to the murder of george floyd in minnesota.\ndesantis has also stationed florida national guard troops at the texas-mexico border and sent them to washington, dc, to help protect the us capitol during the inauguration of president joe biden.\nthe announcement on thursday came during a broader rollout of desantis' plan to bolster florida's national guard, which included $100 million in funding proposals to establish three new armories, build a new headquarters for the national guard counter drug program and provide support for florida national guardsmen seeking higher-education degrees.",
    "three united states military doctors have blown the whistle on documents allegedly from the united states department of defense (dod) that they had access to, which show \u201cskyrocketing rates of disease\u201d since the introduction and mandating of the ccp virus vaccines in armed forces, human rights attorney leigh dundas told the epoch times.\ndundas was recently approached by dr. samuel sigoloff, special forces flight surgeon lt. col. peter chambers, and aerospace occupational medicine specialist lt. col. theresa long.\nthey handed documents to dundas, who appeared recently with attorney tom renz in a five-hour hearing organized by sen. ron johnson (r-wis.) titled \u201ccovid-19: second opinion.\u201d\nrenz shared some of the numbers related to medical disorders in the u.s. military data with the epoch times.\nthe whistleblowers, who are represented by renz, gave him the data \u201cunder penalty of perjury,\u201d he said during the hearing.\nrenz intends to submit the information to the courts, he told johnson.\nthe dod responded that the dmed (defense medical epidemiology database) data from 2016 to 2020 that the whistleblowers brought up was erroneous and incomplete, and is currently under review.\n\u201cdha\u2019s armed forces surveillance division (afsd) conducted a complete review of the data contained in the defense medical epidemiology database (dmed) and found that the data was incorrect for the years 2016-2020,\u201d maj. charlie dietz, a spokesperson for the dod, told the epoch times.\n\u201cdmed is a web-based tool to query de-identified active component personnel and medical event data contained within the defense medical surveillance system (dmss).\n\u201ccomparing the dmed database to the source data contained in dmss, afhsd discovered that the total number of medical diagnoses from 2016-2020 that were accessible in dmed represented only a small fraction of actual medical diagnoses for those years. in contrast, the 2021 total number of medical diagnoses were up to date in dmed. comparison of 2021 to 2016-2020 resulted in the appearance of significant increased occurrence of all medical diagnoses in 2021 because of the under-reported data for 2016-2020. afhsd has taken dmed offline to identify and correct the root-cause of the data corruption,\u201d dietz said.\nrenz responded:\n\u201cthe dod has claimed that the dmed data from the years 2016-2020 was incorrect. this is absurd. we spend millions of dollars per year on dmed and people monitoring dmed which is one of the premier epidemiological databases in the world. accuracy in this database is critical as it is used to monitor for health issues in our troops.\n\u201cthe dod would have us believe that the dmed database was wrong from 2016-2020 but then magically was corrected in 2021 despite the fact that they had not noticed it was wrong until we pointed it out in our testimony before senator johnson. further, we are asked to believe that in 2020, the year of what they claim to be the greatest pandemic since 1918, and despite the fact that it is documented that the cdc was also watching this database, no one noticed an error of 20 million-plus injury/disease codes per year,\u201d renz told the epoch times.\n\u201cthe department of defense, the biden administration is on notice they must preserve these records and this must be

    "three united states military doctors have blown the whistle on documents allegedly from the united states department of defense (dod) that they had access to, which show \"skyrocketing rates of disease\" since the introduction and mandating of the ccp virus vaccines in armed forces, human rights attorney leigh dundas told the epoch times.\ndundas was recently approached by dr. samuel sigoloff, special forces flight surgeon lt. col. peter chambers, and aerospace occupational medicine specialist lt. col. theresa long.\nthey handed documents to dundas, who appeared recently with attorney tom renz in a five-hour hearing organized by sen. ron johnson (r-wis.) titled \" covid-19: second opinion .\"\nrenz shared some of the numbers related to medical disorders in the u.s. military data with the epoch times.\nthe whistleblowers, who are represented by renz, gave him the data \"under penalty of perjury,\" he said during the hearing\nrenz intends to submit the information to the courts, he told johnson.\nthe dod responded that the dmed (defense medical epidemiology database) data from 2016 to 2020 that the whistleblowers brought up was erroneous and incomplete, and is currently under review.\n\"dha\u2019s armed forces surveillance division (afsd) conducted a complete review of the data contained in the defense medical epidemiology database (dmed) and found that the data was incorrect for the years 2016-2020,\" maj. charlie dietz, a spokesperson for the dod, told the epoch times.\n\"dmed is a web-based tool to query de-identified active component personnel and medical event data contained within the defense medical surveillance system (dmss).\n\"comparing the dmed database to the source data contained in dmss, afhsd discovered that the total number of medical diagnoses from 2016-2020 that were accessible in dmed represented only a small fraction of actual medical diagnoses for those years. in contrast, the 2021 total number of medical diagnoses were up to date in dmed. comparison of 2021 to 2016-2020 resulted in the appearance of significant increased occurrence of all medical diagnoses in 2021 because of the under-reported data for 2016-2020. afhsd has taken dmed offline to identify and correct the root-cause of the data corruption,\" dietz said.\nrenz responded: \"the dod has claimed that the dmed data from the years 2016-2020 was incorrect. this is absurd. we spend millions of dollars per year on dmed and people monitoring dmed which is one of the premier epidemiological databases in the world. accuracy in this database is critical as it is used to monitor for health issues in our troops.\n\"the dod would have us believe that the dmed database was wrong from 2016-2020 but then magically was corrected in 2021 despite the fact that they had not noticed it was wrong until we pointed it out in our testimony before senator johnson. further, we are asked to believe that in 2020, the year of what they claim to be the

    "recently i published a book of speculative nonfiction about the possibility of a civil war in the united states. in the opening chapter, i imagine a scenario in which a carnivalesque group of far-right activists takes over a bridge and refuses to leave, provoking a response from federal authorities. my fantasy became reality recently, except not in a rural american county, as i had envisioned it, but in windsor, ontario. for five years, i have been studying american political rage, its sources, its abyssal depths, its vertiginous fracturing power. i thought i was studying an external phenomenon at a distance, and i was. now the rage has come for me. the anti-vax trucker convoy has made it up close and personal.\nthree weeks ago, truckers formed a convoy to protest the cross-border covid-vaccine mandate. last weekend, they rolled into my toronto neighborhood, near bloor street and avenue road. i went down to bear witness to the spectacle. the scene was not surprising to me: the same sort of people i\u2019d seen at donald trump rallies and prepper conventions were there, with their hollowed-out faces intimate with pain, and their perpetually misspelled signs, and their sense of belonging to a community of the excluded. i confess that they disgusted me. i found myself stopping several people on the street and telling them to go home, that they weren\u2019t wanted here.\ndavid frum: trucker blockades in canada may just be the beginning\nthe truckers want \u201cfreedom\u201d from mandates and have called for prime minister justin trudeau to resign. they won\u2019t achieve either of these goals, so what they\u2019re doing now amounts to disruption for disruption\u2019s sake. trucks have been driving around the entrances to the ottawa airport in a kind of slow-motion blockade. this is a deliberate tactic to force the federal government to take action. the protesters want confrontation with trudeau, not doug ford, the conservative premier of ontario, because only such a confrontation could save their movement. their forces are diminishing: about 1,000 people are left in the ottawa convoy, although that number may rise over the weekend. their main avenue of fundraising has been suspended; a week after gofundme stopped all trucker fundraising activities, the conservative government of ontario froze all givesendgo donations. the federal government has, so far, resisted the impulse to call in the military, and it is quite right to do so. every day the truckers remain in ottawa, they appall a larger and larger segment of the canadian population. \u201cnever interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake,\u201d as napoleon said. time is firmly on the authorities\u2019 side, if not that of the people suffering in ottawa.\nultimately, i know that this trucker convoy will come to nothing. its power has been exaggerated by u.s. media, principally fox news. nearly 60 percent of canadians find the protesters \u201coffensive and inappropriate.\u201d more to the point, 88 percent of people in canada over the age of 4 have been vaccinated, including 85 percent of those in the trucking profession. the main trucking advocacy groups are on board with the vaccine mandate, as are the teamsters. at their peak, the trucker protests had just 8,000 people. the conservative party of canada has told the truckers to go home; they have virtually no mainstream political support, except from a few remote members of parliament from saskatchewan. nobody sensible can feel threatened by anything that comes out of saskatchewan.\ndirect military confrontation with the convoy would be the worst strategy; after all, nearly a quarter of the protesters have their kids with them. most likely the government will resolve to prosecute everyone involved in planning the convoy and investigate all foreign sources of support. the truckers have made life hell for their fellow citizens and threatened the democratic process, impotently but intentionally. custodial sentences, massive fines, and class-action lawsuits are all coming. these situations never end well for the hostage-takers.\non some level, though, even that kind of reaction seems over-the-top to me. these protests have been peaceful. i think that if you want to see accelerationist or insurgent tendencies, you have to squint. everyone i have spoken with who has actually been to these rallies has described them to me as a tailgate. several sources reported nazi-flag sightings, but the nazi flags in question were accusing trudeau of being a nazi. i guess it\u2019s a small comfort that, for the trucker convoy in ottawa, the nazis are still the bad guys, unlike for, say, the \u201cjews will not replace us\u201d crowd in charlottesville, virginia. the rally in my neighborhood took place at the corner where the royal ontario museum happens to be. during the rally, the museum didn\u2019t even close. i\u2019m sure the trucks looked impressive on twitter, if you angled the phone just right to make them look dangerous, but there, in person, kids were strolling by on their way to look at dinosaurs. january 6, it wasn\u2019t.\nread: trump\u2019s next coup has already begun\nthe truckers matter principally as an example of an american political proxy conflict spilling over our border, and as a harbinger of more such conflicts. peter sloly, the ottawa police chief, has declared that a \u201csizable element\u201d from the u.s. has been involved in fundraising and organizing. the ottawa police have been overwhelmed by 911 calls intended to disrupt operations, and \u201cthey were coming in from the united states,\u201d according to sloly. by far, the largest supporters of the trucker convoy on social media are americans, namely donald trump and elon musk. (one of trump\u2019s former \u201cscience advisers\u201d has attended rallies.) republican senator ted cruz is way, way more into the trucker convoy than any canadian conservative is. this episode is no doubt just the beginning of the nightmare of living next to the united states in its time of breakdown. as american politics enters a state of complete toxicity, veering into insurgency, its violence and misinformation networks will inevitably spread across the border.\nso why was i, at the trucker convoy in toronto, gripped by a deep physical loathing, true abjection? the truckers are operating on the level of narrative and symbolism. their internal documents, leaked to the guardian, reveal the usual conspiratorial thinking underlying their movement: that world leaders planned the pandemic and the rest of the \u201cgreat reset\u201d garbage. the truckers disgust me because they believe lies and want to force their lies on the rest of the country. they disgust me because they are not playing by the rules and represent a threat to decent, orderly citizens. if i\u2019m being honest, in some part of my canadian soul they disgust me because they\u2019re making a scene. ultimately, they disgust me because they are so disgusted, and their anger and loathing have now provoked a mirroring anger and loathing in myself.\nfor the first time, i felt political rage: a sharp rise in testosterone, blinding and stupefying and violent. i am ashamed to have felt it. clearly men should not be in power. our hormones make us too unreliable. testosterone is a hell of a drug. on my way home, i saw stragglers from the convoy lining up outside the japanese-cheesecake bakery and the pot shops that have come to dominate toronto\u2019s urban landscape. i wanted them gone. this was not a healthy desire. the desire to punish, which is the dominant motive of both the left and the right in the united states, is fundamentally stupid. i hoped we could avoid it in canada.\ni now have the anger i\u2019ve been studying. i now know what it tastes like. and telling myself that the truckers don\u2019t matter, that the convoy will have exactly zero effect on public-health policy in canada, doesn\u2019t make the anger go away. while i was writing the next civil war, i worked hard at suspending judgment, at concentrating on hearing people and trying to understand their motivations, even if they were nazis or violent criminals. i worked so hard to resist the loathing and the rage. now they are with me, at my doorstep and in my heart. i want nothing to do with either. unfortunately, i know more is coming. when you live next to a junkie, you can expect something flaming to land in your backyard eventually. america is a political-anger junkie; the trucker convoy is something flaming that has landed in our backyard. how do we keep ourselves from burning?\n\u200b\u200bwhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission. thank you for supporting the atlantic.",

    "summary\nthe covid vaccines are basically being forcibly thrust upon our military and nobody is allowed to ask questions, challenge the safety of the vaccine, look at what\u2019s inside the vaccine, or challenge the wisdom of discharging soldiers who refuse to be vaccinated. it is troubling that standard military procedures for vaccines are being bypassed for the covid vaccines.\nwhen a top navy pilot crashes a $100m stealth fighter jet (allegedly 72 hours after his booster), everyone is put under a gag order. that is standard. but crashes like that are not.\nwhat i know for sure is that my military sources tell me that the us military will take all necessary steps to ensure that nobody finds out that the covid vaccines are killing people, jeopardizing the safety of our armed forces, jeopardizing our readiness, and causing untold amounts of damage. just like there was a cover-up when the dod dmed data leaked out, i expect a cover-up here.\nso we may never find out what really happened here. this isn\u2019t an honest level playing field.\nsources\nmy sources for the information in this article are members of the military and news sources available on the internet.\ni believe the story at real raw news is almost certainly false, but the crash is real.\nwhat happened\nreal raw news reported the f-35 crash story claiming that an experienced pilot flying a $100m f-35 fighter jet had been boosted 72 hours earlier and experienced a myocarditis incident during landing which caused him to crash land the plane on the deck of the uss carl vinson. the plane quickly slid off the deck and into the sea. the article claimed he muttered \u201cfucking vaccine\u201d right before the crash.\nsounds plausible, but did this really happen?\nthe jet crashed for sure and slid off the deck. that has been verified via leaked footage verified by the navy.\nas for the other details, that remains to be determined.\nthe problem is that mike baxter, who claims to be a former mainstream journalist, writes every story on the site. i was hard pressed to find a single true story on their website. this makes real raw news a very unreliable source in my mind. in short, i wouldn\u2019t believe anything i read on that site.\nso lacking further details, the safest assumption is that the story behind the crash is a complete fabrication.\nsomeone else will have to break the story for anyone to have confidence in what really happened.\nhere are other stories about the incident:\nfact check-u.s. navy pilot involved in landing mishap did not eject after having an adverse effect to a covid shot, navy says\nleaked video shows harrowing f-35 crash aboard carrier carl vinson\nwatch: navy verifies leaked footage showing f-35c crash on uss carl vinson\nwhat i learned from my friends in the military\nbut this story did cause me to reach out to my friends in the military to see if they knew what really happened. what i found when i did that was even more shocking.\nthe military is being ordered from the top down to take the covid vaccine and not ask any questions. when there are incidents involving the vaccine, a cover story is fabricated so as not to implicate the covid vaccine since doing so could create vaccine hesitancy. the covid vaccines are so controlled in the military that not even the pharmacists or doctors on a military base are permitted to handle them or ask questions. this is unprecedented. when doctors try to ask questions about safety, they are told just to follow orders. again this is unprecedented.\nso when an f-35 pilot supposedly gets a covid booster just 72 hours before he has an acute case of myocarditis causing him to crash land and destroy a $100m aircraft, nobody wants to talk about it. it will be under investigation with everyone under a gag order for around 30 days. when that ends, we may find out more. or maybe not. until then, it\u2019s all speculation.\nmy sources basically say the vaccines are dangerous, they can see the health impacts on the soldiers, that the vaccines don\u2019t work, and that it is insane to discharge soldiers that the military has invested (in some cases) decades of training just because they won\u2019t take a vaccine that biden wants them to take. the number of deaths from covid are trivially small in the military and hardly justifies the purge. it is nonsensical.\nin short, the military brass is forcing these vaccines down people\u2019s throats and will not tolerate any discussion. as we saw from the dmed database fiasco, if incriminating evidence is leaked, the military will rapidly cover it up (though the cover-up was sloppy and they are digging themselves even deeper into a hole).\nwhat really happened?\ndid the pilot just get boosted 72 hours before the crash? was he diagnosed with myocarditis? did he really say \u201cfucking vaccine\u201d before he crashed?\ni don\u2019t know but i\u2019m always impressed with what my readers know, so maybe we have a reader or two on board the uss carl vinson who can enlighten us in the comments.",

    "in the 1990s, some reserve and national guard officers, including some jags like me, and government and private physicians researching anthrax, formed a working group to oppose dod\u2019s first anthrax vaccine. we stood on science, fact, law, not \u201creligion\u201d and fetus fetishes with the goal of positive impact for individual servicemembers and their families, and the military mission. a comparison of our motive and tactics with the baseless \u201creligious infringement\u201d and \u201cconstitutional\u201d claims of some current covid military refusniks reveals how insidious, cynical, politicized, and dangerous to our national security their tactics are.\nunlike covid\u2019s dramatic entry to world stage, anthrax emerged as a dod focus during gulf i for no apparent reason except anthrax and mideast terrorists exist in arid soil. anthrax is not a contagious bacteria or virus like small pox and covid, it is spores spread by direct contact, most commonly through the skin of workers who handle hides and wool of animals living in spore-infected soil, and possibly by eating their meat. anthrax has been used as a bioweapon; in wwii the british dropped infected cow carcasses to starving germans. the sole documented lethal modern anthrax attack was in the u.s. northeast, at one point attributed to a researcher in a u.s. army laboratory mailing a stable powdered anthrax through the u.s. postal service. to be effective against our military, it would have to infect many people at once, which requires aerosol delivery. to make such a delivery system from wild anthrax that would not also contaminate those who used it would require sophisticated engineering (the russians famously failed at it a 1978 68 fatality lab spill). so far, no such system is known to exist, and no anthrax attack occurred in the ensuing 20 years fighting terrorists on mideast soil.\nanthrax has harmed our military through dod\u2019s vaccine. first, dod committed to en masse vaccination without any clear threat and before it had a vaccine, much less safe and effective against a hypothetical method for an anthrax attack. to date dod does not have a vaccine proven efficacious against inhaled anthrax. no willing reputable manufacturer would invest in research and development because the civilian market is the tiny number of people who work with animal hides/wool. dod found an almost defunct manufacturer in mi who said it had such an anthrax vaccine in stock. it had something manufactured by a predecessor in the 1970s with a 1950s formula \u2013 a 40 year old formula predating modern trials and federal review, without proper storage for 20 years. the company was not a researcher. they cranked up the old stuff with adjuvants and gave it to us with no transparency on the risk.\nsecond, the rollout was years of confusion on dose and boosters. it started with 4-6 jabs the first year then every six months forever with dire warnings of health issues and having to start over if any were missed or late, impossible to administer in the transient military. predictably, young healthy people were injured and losses to the military. especially for the active duty and junior ranks without private care before obamacare, reporting of adverse reactions was spotty. people could not get it on time because of duty locations and had to start over, ending up double dosed. others left the military before completing, with the vaccine unavailable privately. it especially affected the country\u2019s large reserve where troop strength is transient but more vital to national security than most americans know. contrast with covid vaccines, among the most monitored ever in part because they employ new technology still in active competitive research. global vaccine companies are sharing efficacy and safety data with all levels of government, private physicians, researchers and the public. private physicians are watching efficacy and adverse reactions in their patients who include most of the military (reservists who do not get military healthcare). the adjustments in doses and boosters is warranted given our massive diverse population, the new technology and urgency of this virus \u2013 while the nation was still at war against mideast terrorists when it began. the overall success of the covid vaccines is despite unprecedented interference by political operatives and grifters driving panic, insane lies and conspiracy theories.\nthirty years later, despite no documented aerosolized anthrax attack, hundreds of thousands of adherents to the \u201creligion\u201d pastiche have taken the troubled anthrax vaccine against a farfetched threat of an arabic terrorist anthrax attack, without \u201cfetus\u201d objections. they raise \u201creligion\u201d against only this vaccine that has scientifically unassailable high efficacy against rampant human-to-human spread, long-term debilitation, mass death, and crippling our health care systems, offering cult talk, conspiracy theories and grifts. they ignore the facts that most vaccines and even over-the-counter medicines were developed with human fetal tissue and dna, and that the covid vaccine was not developed only with aborted fetuses and does not put fetus parts (and microchips) into arms.\nif ever there were a basis for conspiracy theories, it is the lurid and terrifying real and related facts of the only anthrax attack on americans and connections to our anthrax objectors group. but we still stood on science and law. those anthrax attacks occurred in 2001, shortly after 9/11, by mailed envelopes containing powdered anthrax. it killed a random elderly woman in connecticut. i and the two most publicized anthrax vaccine refusers in our objectors group, two connecticut national guard pilots, lived and served in connecticut. the federal government attributed the attacks to an army anthrax research doctor who was a member of our group. another anthrax research doctor in the group was close with him and claimed the government started a fire on her property to threaten her work. the army anthrax researcher killed himself when he learned he was to be charged. it shocked our group who certainly did not foresee such a distinguished member accused. the media had covered the problems with the dod anthrax vaccinations supposedly needed for a terrorist attack. all roads pointed to dod, until doj said they were wrong about the anthrax coming from army. today, anything similar with covid would generate mass media and mob conspiracy theories and lies, sadly, apparently even in the military.\nstaying the course with science and law, two years later a jag in our group (in his private practice) with the now renowned national security attorney mark zaid succeeded in getting a ruling against dod from the esteemed u.s. district judge emmet sullivan that servicemembers have right to informed consent for vaccines \u2013 disclosure of risks and right to refuse. that temporarily stopped the dod anthrax vaccine and forced dod to address some issues. by then the old shelf vaccine was gone. contrast with covid vaccine cases spewing conspiracies and religious exemptions which no court has upheld. there have only been limits to some regulatory powers over workplaces, and the supreme court upheld mandatory vaccinations of health care workers.\nin sum, we will not hear science and law from military covid refusniks because there is none upon which they can prevail. when you don\u2019t have the law on your side, argue the facts. if no facts, argue your personal \u201creligious beliefs\u201d about science and the constitution. dod cannot bend to fabrications, mob rule, and unbecoming conduct wrapped in \u201creligious\u201d cloth. the best way dod can stand for good order, discipline, cohesion, and morale is to ensure the discharges proceed only on provable facts and law.",
