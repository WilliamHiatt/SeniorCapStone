https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/05/world-health-organization-global-pandemic-treaty-includes-plan-mandatory-universal-digital-passport-system/
this week, global elitists and world leaders from across the west are gathered in davos, switzerland for the who’s annual world health assembly.
while convened, attendees from all 194 who member countries are set to vote on major amendments to the international health regulations that would effectively strip all power away from sovereign countries and turn it over to the who’s global health board in the event of a pandemic.
if the ratifications are agreed to this week, the who would also be granted sole authority over what constitutes a pandemic. and, as we have seen over the past two years, just about anything qualifies as an ‘existential threat to public health’ including, but not limited to: misinformation, parents protesting at school boards, free speech, and – of course – racism. the fact that the who is on the cusp of unrestricted authority to decide these measures should terrify every american.
what’s more, the changes also include plans for a mandatory and universal vaccine passport system that’s overseen by the who. in fact, the globalist organization has already contracted a german-based company, called ‘t-systems’, to develop the technology.
they’re that confident the measures will be approved.
from the joint who and t-systems announcement:
“the world health organization (who) will make it easier for its member states to introduce digital vaccination certificates in the future. the who is setting up a gateway for this purpose. it enables qr codes on electronic vaccination certificates to be checked across national borders. it is intended to serve as a standard procedure for other vaccinations such as polio or yellow fever after covid-19. the who has selected t-systems as an industry partner to develop the vaccination validation services.”
according to garret mehl – the head of who’s department of digital health and innovation, the plan for the new universal system is to issue a qr code digital id to every single person on the planet – that way, everyone is tracked. but, don’t worry, it’s just a “trust-building” exercise, mehl explains.
oh, is that all?
from mehl (via the brownstone institute):
“vaccination certificates that are tamper-proof and digitally verifiable build trust. who is therefore supporting member states in building national and regional trust networks and verification technology. the who’s gateway service also serves as a bridge between regional systems. it can also be used as part of future vaccination campaigns and home-based records.”
aside from the fact that the who is an international, unelected, and unaccountable body with absolutely no concern for individual freedoms, the organization is led by tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, who repeatedly pushed outright lies and crippling restrictions throughout the china virus pandemic.
needless to say – americans shouldn’t want this guy anywhere near power. but, thanks to treasonous joe biden, the globalist left, and the dc swamp, this globalist organization and its crazed leader will have absolute control.
when you consider the fact that the biden regime purposefully hid the proposed amendments to the treaty when it was submitted in january (therefore, skipping the democratic process) – and only made the proposal public months later (just before the who assembly), we are way beyond an impeachable offense. this is borderline treason.

the “spanish flu” killed an estimated 50-100 million people during a pandemic 1918-19. what if the story we have been told about this pandemic isn’t true?
what if, instead, the killer infection was neither the flu nor spanish in origin?
newly analyzed documents reveal that the “spanish flu” may have been a military vaccine experiment gone awry.
in looking back on the 100th anniversary of the end of world war i, we need to delve deeper to solve this mystery.
summary
the reason modern technology has not been able to pinpoint the killer influenza strain from this pandemic is because influenza was not the killer.
more soldiers died during wwi from disease than from bullets.
the pandemic was not flu. an estimated 95% (or higher) of the deaths were caused by bacterial pneumonia, not influenza/a virus.
the pandemic was not spanish. the first cases of bacterial pneumonia in 1918 trace back to a military base in fort riley, kansas. vaccine epidemic: how ... mary holland (editor) buy new $13.99 (as of 01:40 utc - details )
from january 21 – june 4, 1918, an experimental bacterial meningitis vaccine cultured in horses by the rockefeller institute for medical research in new york was injected into soldiers at fort riley.
during the remainder of 1918 as those soldiers – often living and traveling under poor sanitary conditions – were sent to europe to fight, they spread bacteria at every stop between kansas and the frontline trenches in france.
one study describes soldiers “with active infections (who) were aerosolizing the bacteria that colonized their noses and throats, while others—often, in the same “breathing spaces”—were profoundly susceptible to invasion of and rapid spread through their lungs by their own or others’ colonizing bacteria.” (1)
the “spanish flu” attacked healthy people in their prime. bacterial pneumonia attacks people in their prime. flu attacks the young, old and immunocompromised.
when ww1 ended on november 11, 1918, soldiers returned to their home countries and colonial outposts, spreading the killer bacterial pneumonia worldwide.
during ww1, the rockefeller institute also sent the antimeningococcic serum to england, france, belgium, italy and other countries, helping spread the epidemic worldwide.
during the pandemic of 1918-19, the so-called “spanish flu” killed 50-100 million people, including many soldiers.
many people do not realize that disease killed far more soldiers on all sides than machine guns or mustard gas or anything else typically associated with wwi.
i have a personal connection to the spanish flu. among those killed by disease in 1918-19 are members of both of my parents’ families.
on my father’s side, his grandmother sadie hoyt died from pneumonia in 1918. sadie was a chief yeoman in the navy. her death left my grandmother rosemary and her sister anita to be raised by their aunt. sadie’s sister marian also joined the navy. she died from “the influenza” in 1919.
on my mother’s side, two of her father’s sisters died in childhood. all of the family members who died lived in new york city.
i suspect many american families, and many families worldwide, were impacted in similar ways by the mysterious spanish flu.
in 1918, “influenza” or flu was a catchall term for disease of unknown origin. it didn’t carry the specific meaning it does today.
it meant some mystery disease which dropped out of the sky. in fact, influenza is from the medieval latin “influential” in an astrological sense, meaning a visitation under the influence of the stars.
why is what happened 100 years ago important now?
between 1900-1920, there were enormous efforts underway in the industrialized world to build a better society. i will use new york as an example to discuss three major changes to society which occurred in ny during that time and their impact on mortality from infectious diseases.
1. clean water and sanitation
in the late 19th century through the early 20th century, new york built an extraordinary system to bring clean water to the city from the catskills, a system still in use today. new york city also built over 6000 miles of sewer to take away and treat waste, which protects the drinking water. the world health organization acknowledges the importance of clean water and sanitation in combating infectious diseases. (2)
2. electricity
in the late 19th century through the early 20th century, new york built a power grid and wired the city so power was available in every home. electricity allows for refrigeration. refrigeration is an unsung hero as a public health benefit. when food is refrigerated from farm to table, the public is protected from potential infectious diseases. cheap renewable energy is important for many reasons, including combating infectious diseases. dissolving illusions: ... bystrianyk, roman best price: $38.50 buy new $21.60 (as of 11:00 utc - details)
3. pharmaceutical
in the late 19th century through the early 20th century, new york became the home of the rockefeller institute for medical research (now rockefeller university). the institute is where the modern pharmaceutical industry was born. the institute pioneered many of the approaches the pharmaceutical industry uses today, including the preparation of vaccine serums, for better or worse. the vaccine used in the fort riley experiment on soldiers was made in horses.
us mortality rates data from the turn of the 20th century to 1965 clearly indicates that clean water, flushing toilets, effective sewer systems and refrigerated foods all combined to effectively reduce mortality from infectious diseases before vaccines for those diseases became available.
have doctors and the pharmaceutical manufacturers taken credit for reducing mortality from infectious disease which rightfully belongs to sandhogs, plumbers, electricians and engineers?
if hubris at the rockefeller institute in 1918 led to a pandemic disease which killed millions of people, what lessons can we learn and apply to 2018?
the disease was not spanish
while watching an episode of american experience on pbs a few months ago, i was surprised to hear that the first cases of “spanish flu” occurred at fort riley, kansas in 1918. i thought, how is it possible this historically important event could be so badly misnamed 100 years ago and never corrected?
why “spanish”?
spain was one of a few countries not involved in world war i. most of the countries involved in the war censored their press.
free from censorship concerns, the earliest press reports of people dying from disease in large numbers came from spain. the warring countries did not want to additionally frighten the troops, so they were content to scapegoat spain. soldiers on all sides would be asked to cross no man’s land into machine gun fire, which was frightening enough without knowing that the trenches were a disease breeding ground.
one hundred years later, it’s long past time to drop “spanish” from all discussion of this pandemic. if the flu started at a united states military base in kansas, then the disease could and should be more aptly named.
in order to prevent future disasters, the us (and the rest of the world) must take a hard look at what really caused the pandemic.
it is possible that one of the reasons the spanish flu has never been corrected is that it helps disguise the origin of the pandemic.
if the origin of the pandemic involved a vaccine experiment on us soldiers, then the us may prefer calling it spanish flu instead of the fort riley bacteria of 1918, or something similar. the spanish flu started at the location this experimental bacterial vaccine was given making it the prime suspect as the source of the bacterial infections which killed so many.
it would be much more difficult to maintain the marketing mantra of “vaccines save lives” if a vaccine experiment originating in the united states during the years of primitive manufacturing caused the deaths of 50-100 million people.
“vaccines save lives … except we may have killed 50-100 million people in 1918-19” is a far less effective sales slogan than the overly simplistic “vaccines save lives.”
the disease which killed so many was not flu or a virus. it was bacterial.
during the mid-2000’s there was much talk about “pandemic preparedness.” influenza vaccine manufacturers in the united states received billions of taxpayer dollars to develop vaccines to make sure that we don’t have another lethal pandemic “flu,” like the one in 1918-19.
capitalizing on the “flu” part of spanish flu helped vaccine manufacturers procure billion dollar checks from governments, even though scientists knew at the time that bacterial pneumonia was the real killer. miller’s review ... miller, neil z. best price: $8.32 buy new $14.48 (as of 04:45 utc - details)
it is not my opinion that bacterial pneumonia was the real killer – thousands of autopsies confirm this fact.
according to a 2008 national institute of health paper, bacterial pneumonia was the killer in a minimum of 92.7% of the 1918-19 autopsies reviewed. it is likely higher than 92.7%.
the researchers looked at more than 9000 autopsies, and “there were no negative (bacterial) lung culture results.”
“… in the 68 higher-quality autopsy series, in which the possibility of unreported negative cultures could be excluded, 92.7% of autopsy lung cultures were positive for ≥1 bacterium. … in one study of approximately 9000 subjects who were followed from clinical presentation with influenza to resolution or autopsy, researchers obtained, with sterile technique, cultures of either pneumococci or streptococci from 164 of 167 lung tissue samples. there were 89 pure cultures of pneumococci; 19 cultures from which only streptococci were recovered; 34 that yielded mixtures of pneumococci and/or streptococci; 22 that yielded a mixture of pneumococci, streptococci, and other organisms (prominently pneumococci and nonhemolytic streptococci); and 3 that yielded nonhemolytic streptococci alone. there were no negative lung culture results.” (3)
pneumococci or streptococci were found in “164 of (the) 167 lung tissue samples” autopsied. that is 98.2%. bacteria was the killer.

https://nation.com.pk/08-Apr-2021/russia-offers-pakistan-vaccine-energy-military-equipment
islamabad - russia on wednesday assured pakistan of full cooperation in diverse areas particularly to meet the country’s requirements in energy, security equipment and supply of coronavirus vaccine.
russian foreign minister sergey lavrov in a joint press conference with foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi here at the foreign affairs ministry said substantive talks were held on the early construction of the flagship north-south gas pipeline project between karachi and lahore.
to further support the energy-deficit pakistan, he said his country had offered delivery of russian liquified natural gas (lng) through the russian companies gazprom and novatek and was awaiting response from the partners in pakistan.
the russian foreign minister expressed satisfaction over the growth of bilateral trade by 46 percent and expressed readiness to “further strengthen economic relations”. he mentioned that substantive growth of bilateral trade was mainly due to trade of over 200 millions wheat to pakistan and added, “we want to make this increase sustainable and diversity our trade”.
he said pak-russia intergovernmental commission to meet in moscow the current year would be a key step in defining the sphere of cooperation in multiple areas.
on nuclear energy, he said russia’s rosatom and pakistan’s nuclear energy commission were in touch for cooperation for use of technology for medicine and industry.
both sides agreed to further conduct military exercises, drills
regarding security cooperation, lavrov said russia was ready to “strengthen pakistan’s anti-terrorist capacity including supply of special equipment”. “this serves in the interest of all states of the region,” he said, adding an agreement was today reached on conducting more joint military exercises including the arabian monsoon maritime drill.
since pakistan’s accession to shanghai cooperation organization (sco) three years ago, he said, the country was actively pursuing its anti-terrorist strategy. lavrov expressed concern over the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan and the rise of terrorist activities in north and east of country. he mentioned that russia and pakistan agreed to “further facilitate the agreement among afghan parties through inclusive political dialogue”.
on ties between pakistan and india, the russian foreign minister welcomed the efforts leading towards the normalisation of relations between the two countries.
in the backdrop of tension in middle east, he favoured establishment of the state of palestine, saying that “russia stands to facilitate a direct dialogue between israel and palestine”.
foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi said pakistan was keen to “build a strong multi-dimensional relationship” with russia, considering it a “priority with a new significant approach”.
welcoming the visit of a russian foreign minister “in almost a decade”, he said pakistan regarded russia an as “important factor” in the stability of region. qureshi mentioned that the talks focused on strengthening cooperation in trade, energy, security and cooperation at united nations and said, “in our cooperation, sky is the limit”. he said pakistan in view of its energy needs could greatly benefit from russia.
qureshi said the two countries had scope to cooperate within framework of pak-russia security dialogue and thanked the russian foreign minister for acknowledging pakistan’s role in anti-terrorism. he mentioned briefing his russian counterpart the situation at pakistan’s border with india. he expressed confidence that visit of russian foreign minister would “deepen friendship and high-level contacts” between the two countries.
in response to a question, qureshi said pakistan had registered the russian covid-19 vaccine sputnik in the country which was yielding good results. he said pakistan was looking forward for the russian collaboration for local production of vaccine. the russian foreign minister said his government had provided 50,000 doses to pakistan and intended to supply more 150,000 doses.

a canadian armed forces officer who urged other military members against helping to distribute covid-19 vaccines has pleaded guilty to conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline.
officer cadet laszlo kenderesi pleaded not guilty to behaving in a scandalous manner unbecoming an officer.
military prosecutors have withdrawn a third charge of endeavouring to persuade another person to join in a mutiny, for which the 60-year-old could have faced up to life in prison.
a canadian armed forces officer who publicly urged other military members to disobey orders and not help distribute covid-19 vaccines apologized thursday, saying he regreted his actions and "public display of disloyalty."
officer cadet laszlo kenderesi delivered the apology at the start of his court martial where he was scheduled to be tried on three separate charges, including one of endeavouring to persuade another person to join in a mutiny.
however, military prosecutors told the court shortly after the start of kenderesi's trial at canadian forces base borden that they had withdrawn the mutiny charge, which carried a maximum penalty of up to life in prison.
a short time later, kenderesi pleaded guilty to one charge of conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline before entering a not-guilty plea to the third charge of behaving in a scandalous manner unbecoming an officer.
the charges relate to a speech at an anti-lockdown rally in toronto's dundas square on dec. 5, 2020, in which kenderesi appeared in full military uniform and spoke out against what he called "killer" vaccines.
"i'm calling upon all military personnel to do the same, not to accept any unjust orders, which would be giving out and distributing vaccines," kenderesi told rally participants, according to a transcript read in court.
a video of his comments was later published online.
the armed forces had only days earlier received formal orders to start planning for the distribution of vaccines across the country, as health canada entered the final stages of reviewing vaccine candidates from pfizer and moderna.
on thursday, kenderesi expressed remorse for his actions as military judge cmdr. martin pelletier prepared to sentence the 60-year-old cadet instructor following his guilty plea to conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline.
"it was wrong for me to present myself as a canadian armed forces member to publicly express my private views," kenderesi said. "i abused the trust that comes with the privilege of wearing the canadian armed forces uniform. i'm sorry."
he later added: "it was not my place to question the orders of the chain of command. i breached the core principle of service by not supporting the lawful authority of the chain of command. i'm ashamed of my public display of disloyalty."
in a separate affidavit read into the record, court heard kenderesi was born and grew up in hungary while that country was under the soviet union's influence, and that the covid-19 lockdowns in 2020 affected him both emotionally and financially.
that included his wife losing her job and the collapse of his trucking business, after which he declared bankruptcy.
court also heard that while kenderesi first joined the canadian armed forces in 1978 and served for years as reserve cadet instructor in borden, he had virtually no contact with the military after 2018.
but even as defence lawyer maj. alexandre gelinas-proulx sought to use these as mitigating factors, prosecutor lt.-cmdr. jennifer besner argued that the underlying issue was one of enforcing discipline in the ranks.
"discipline is the quality that every cf member must have, which allows him or her to put the interests of canada and the interests of the canadian forces before personal interests," besner said.
"this is necessary because canadian forces members must willingly and promptly obey lawful orders that may have very devastating personal consequences."
besner and gelinas-proulx nonetheless agreed in asking that pelletier sentence kenderesi to a severe reprimand and $4,200 fine. they added the officer cadet has already served 80 hours of community service.
pelletier appeared to acknowledge the precedent that his ruling would set for future cases, calling it unique due to the context of the pandemic as well as the public nature of the officer cadet's comments.
"it's not an internal rant," pelletier added.
the results of kenderesi's case could indeed have repercussions on future courts martial for armed forces members who have publicly spoken out against vaccine mandates and other government policies.
that includes warrant officer james topp, the army reservist who was charged earlier this year with two counts of conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline for speaking out against vaccine requirements while wearing his uniform.
topp has since become a celebrity of sorts for some canadians opposed to not only vaccines and pandemic restrictions, but also the federal liberal government, and is currently in the midst of a cross-country march.

washington, feb 2 (reuters) - u.s. soldiers who refuse to get a covid-19 vaccine will be immediately discharged, the u.s. army said on wednesday, saying the move was critical to maintain combat readiness
the army's order applies to regular army soldiers, active-duty army reservists and cadets unless they have approved or pending exemptions, it said in a statement.
the discharge order is the latest from a u.s. military branch removing unvaccinated service membersamid the pandemicafter the pentagon made the vaccine mandatory for all service members in august 2021.
the vast majority of all active duty troops have received at least one dose. roughly 79 uniformed military personnel across the different services have died from the novel coronavirus. read more
"army readiness depends on soldiers who are prepared to train, deploy, fight and win our nation’s wars,” army secretary christine wormuth said. "unvaccinated soldiers present risk to the force and jeopardize readiness."
other branches of the u.s. military, including the u.s. air force, have already begun to remove those who have chosen not to receive a covid vaccine, which were first authorized for emergency use in december 2020.

https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/sweden-to-send-military-aid-to-ukraine-in-break-with-tradition
sweden will break its doctrine of not sending arms to countries engaged in an active conflict, the country's prime minister announced sunday, as the country will send military aid, including anti-tank launchers, helmets and body armor to ukraine.
"sweden is now proposing direct support for ukraine's armed forces. it includes 135,000 field rations, 5,000 helmets, 5,000 body shields and 5,000 anti-tank weapons," prime minister magdalena andersson told a news conference.
andersson underlined that the decision to send this kind of military aid is the first time sweden has sent weapons to a country in an armed conflict since the soviet union invaded finland in 1939.
finland also announced sunday that it is considering whether to send weapons to ukraine directly.
in what would be a departure from its long-standing policy of not allowing weapons to be exported to war zones, finnish defense minister antti kaikkonen said.
the minister also said that finland, which is not a nato member and shares a long border with russia, had given the green light to estonia to send previously finnish-owned field guns to ukraine.
earlier on sunday, european union foreign policy chief josep borrell proposed the idea to eu foreign ministers that eu funds could be used to send weapons and fuel to ukraine.
european commission president ursula von der leyen later said the eu will fund arms supplies to ukraine, ban pro-kremlin media and impose new sanctions on belarus.
asked if finland would send weapons to ukraine directly, kaikkonen said: "we have not ruled that out."
finland will send defense equipment to ukraine, including 2,000 bulletproof vests, 2,000 helmets, 100 stretchers and equipment for two emergency medical care stations, a government statement said.

https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/11/01/air-force-allows-unvaccinated-instructor-pilots-fly-again-amid-pending-lawsuits.html
the air force is allowing instructors who remain unvaccinated against covid-19 to fly again, a change that comes as the result of a pending lawsuit that is stopping the service from punishing those who have refused to get inoculated. the pilots were grounded this summer.
an oct. 25 memo shared with military.com on tuesday issued by maj. gen. phillip stewart, the commander of 19th air force, reverses an aug. 19 decision that kept those unvaccinated teachers from flying.
"instructor pilots, who received final denial of their religious or medical accommodation request for the covid-19 vaccination and requested retirement or separation, will be permitted to fly again until litigation regarding the covid-19 mandate is resolved by the u.s. courts," capt. lauren woods, a spokeswoman for air education and training command, told military.com in an emailed statement.

one of the reasons behind the change is a pending lawsuit filed by troops attached to wright-patterson air force base, ohio, that has led to temporary protections for the more than 9,000 active-duty, active reserve, reserve and national guard members of the air force and space force who asked for a religious exemption from the covid-19 vaccine mandate.
while the oct. 25 memo states that the pending court case "does not affect" the policy that the air force intends to ground unvaccinated flight instructors, but stewart wrote he was reinstating their flying privileges, adding it was "in the best interest of the air force," meaning the policy could change again based on the outcome of the lawsuit.
"this guidance will be reassessed after the final determination of the court," stewart wrote.
nineteenth air force, which is under air education and training command out of joint base san antonio, had grounded the instructor pilots for two months. the policy reversal only applies to instructor pilots, woods said. students who have refused the covid-19 vaccine will still be grounded.
"given the lengthy nature of the administrative exemption process and uncertain outcomes for each specific case, student pilots who have refused the vaccine will remain on administrative hold," woods said in an email. "in order to maximize readiness, training will be prioritized for student pilots who have received the vaccine."
since july 11, the day when the latest figures were released, the department of the air force has administratively separated 834 service members, and nearly 140 airmen and guardians have received religious exemptions.
as of the most recent vaccination data for the department of the air force, 98% of the total force -- active-duty, reserve and air national guard -- had been inoculated against covid-19.
around 12,000 of the 497,000 total personnel in the air force and space force have not been vaccinated.
as of oct. 18, the service had approved more than 1,000 medical and administrative exemptions to the vaccine.
the service members out of wright-patterson who are part of the religious exemption lawsuit are represented by the new york-based siri & glimstad law firm. they were all "found by a chaplain in the air force to hold sincere religious belief substantially burdened by the order to be vaccinated," according to a press release from the firm.
refusers often state that the use of fetal cell lines in the creation of the vaccine prevents them from taking the vaccine because of their views on abortion.
the pfizer and moderna covid-19 vaccines do not need fetal cell lines for development or production but were tested on fetal cell lines replicated from an aborted fetus in the 1970s to ensure their efficacy. only the johnson & johnson vaccine is made using fetal cell lines.
in an attempt to convince some with those religious objections, the air force announced in july that novavax -- a covid-19 vaccine developed without the use of human fetal-derived cell lines or tissue -- would be an option in the near future for airmen and guardians.
"novavax may accommodate those with sincerely held beliefs who felt limited in their options with the previous vaccine offering," maj. gen. sharon bannister, medical operations director, air force surgeon general, said in a statement in july.
since the start of the covid-19 pandemic, there have been approximately 163,000 reported cases of covid-19 in the air force, and 166 deaths, according to the latest data.

we need for members of congress and other american leaders to put the dod's feet to the fire over this. we could be witnessing the sabotaging of the u.s. military, and leadership at the dod either needs to swiftly investigate now, or else we should assume that manipulation of health data for the purpose of hiding harms due to experimental gene therapy injections to be intentionally directed at harming brave members of the u.s. armed forces. this did not need to happen, and it does not need to continue.
find a way to take action. i am a private person who intended to remain under the radar for my entire life. i am now looking into speaking in court, in medical policy meetings (more about that later, but i don't want to tip my hand), and possibly in congress from the position of a dissident. this moment is that important. find your way of participating in holding criminals accountable, and in making greater peace and prosperity out of the future. otherwise, the america that we have going forward is the america that the criminals want to sculpt it to be (and it has been more that way for longer than most americans are willing to admit just yet).
while researching the dmss/dmed numbers, i was told by a ranking member of the u.s. military that this extremely important health data for the u.s. military is in fact exported outside of the united states (to israel) prior to the data being passed from the dmss to the dmed. if true, i find it mind boggling. how could this data not be viewed as a national security interest? what added value from a foreign source could outweigh the risks associated in allowing foreign agents or governments (and we should assume the capture of that information by government) to handle, much less document, the data that tells the u.s. military the readiness levels of the troops?
where were we?
recall where we were, previously.
that article lays out a great case for fraud taking place at the point of publication of the may 2021 msmr. this article should be seen as a companion to that one, laying out a more complete picture of what the data looks like. this article will not focus on 2021 data, but rather the 2016 through 2020 data to get a better understanding of what the data manipulation looks like. i will use this as a reference in future articles, but also for arguments made that will be sent to congress via thomas renz.
we will be examining a lot of charts such as the one below, so let's talk about how to read it.
the grey bars show summary ambulatory data originally reported in may edition msmrs prior to 2021. my strong opinion is that this is true data (prior to what looks on face like massaging of the data for the may 2021 report).
the red bars show summary ambulatory data as published in the may 2021 msmr.
the blue bars are the results of queries performed from dmed in february, 2022.
trend lines (dotted at the top) are not critically important for this article, but advanced chart readers may find maintenance of trends or changes in trends to be interesting. but every reader can look at the trends and ask, "does 2020 look like there was a health crisis?" no. no, it does not.
initial observations
some of this is a repeat from the last article, but we're about to show a lot of these charts, so if you're interested, now is the time to really get a grip on what we're seeing.
for all 2016 and 2018 comparisons, the red/blue bars are elevated from the prior published data in grey for every single major diagnostic category reported. we leave out the "other" category that underwent redefinition. for just one major diagnostic category, the blue bars are elevated above the red bars. we will talk about the importance of the difference. we are examining large collections of different illnesses in the diagnostic categories that follow. there are thousands of icd-10 codes within each of these categories. there may be 2%, 45%, and 700% changes in incidence of illness or injury for various icd-10 codes or collections thereof that describe a specific disease, whereas the change for the overall diagnostic category may be 4% or 12% or 30%, depending on how it all balances together. a large change of rate in an illness with a low rate of incidence may barely impact the change of rate in illness over the larger diagnostic category.
i hope i've made this list plain enough. you can look back here if need be.
the following ordering of the categories is essentially from the greatest incidence (in terms of ambulatory reports) to the least. many of the more interesting categories are near the bottom.
musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (icd-10: m00-m99)
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 4.5% and 4.9%, respectively in this large category. this is one of the smaller changes among the major diagnostic categories, which is consistent with observed distributions of vaccine-associated illness.
mental health disorders (icd-10: f01-f99)
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 6.5% and 6.2%, respectively in this large category. this is one of the smaller changes among the major diagnostic categories. personally, i view the observed rise in mental illness as primarily related to the stress that terrible and terrifying policy has placed citizens under, including the psychological nudges.
nervous system and sense organs (icd-10 codes: g00-g99,h00-h95)
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 6.5% and 7.2%, respectively in this large category. this is still a smaller than average change, but to a large enough category that zooming in may prove interesting.
signs, symptoms, and ill-defined conditions (icd-10 codes: r00-r99)
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 11.7% for each year in this diagnostic category. this may prove to be the most interesting diagnostic category. most major diagnostic categories tend toward correlated disease expression. in this category, diseases and injuries are themselves not the important aspect. these codes are defined by cases in which the etiology is in question. this would be a place where we should expect to see physicians either confused about what a vaccine injury represents or not wanting to state with certainty or believe that a particular vaccine injury is an injury. i talked about this previously, but the second revision of the 2016-2020 data, which is quite large (46.6% on average), looks suspiciously like cover for dramatically higher rates of illness tossed into this bucket.
the post-glitch queries look molded to indicate a trend was already taking place. but there is no such pre-pandemic trend in any other data i've looked at (outside of military database outputs), much less in the other major diagnostic categories.
some of these categories are likely matches for effects of the quasi-vaccines, and there are many more that do aside from the list below:
(r01x) cardiac murmurs and other cardiac sounds
(r03x) abnormal blood-pressure reading, without diagnosis
(r04x) hemorrhage from respiratory passage
(r07x) pain in throat and chest
(r09x) other symptoms and signs involving the circulatory and respiratory system
(r22x) localized swelling, mass and lump
(r77.1) abnormality of globulin
(r77.8) other specified abnormalities of plasma proteins
it may also be that cases categorized as r-codes get recategorized down the road as etiologies are better understood, so illnesses that currently show no increase or modest increase in rates in 2021 could wind up showing substantial increases as the dust settles.
expect me to have a lot more to say about the r-codes down the road, and with as much resolution as we can get.
injury and poisoning (icd-10 codes: s00-t98; dod0101-dod0105)
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 3.7% and 4.5%, respectively in this diagnostic category. my priors are that we will only find interesting stories in this data when we drill down for higher resolution, so not much to say for now. however, this category does include a couple of key icd-10 codes with respect to vaccinations.
there are over 2,000 reports of severe adverse events among military personnel in vaers, which is a database notoriously underreported by factors as high as 100. the distribution of these events skews toward older populations, meaning that military leadership is likely more affected by serious adverse events or even death associated with the experimental covid-19 quasi-vaccines.
from 2020 to 2021, the number of ambulatory reports of poisoning by or adverse events associated with viral vaccines leapt from 113 to 1696 in dmed, more than 15 times as high.
respiratory system (icd-10 codes: j00-j99)
respiratory system (icd-10 codes: j00-j99)
while i would have initially focused more on this diagnostic category, it turns out that most of the codes here have no relationship to either covid-19 or vaccination. a larger portion of serious vaccine adverse events are blood, circulatory, immune-oriented, or related to the nervous system. we will only find interesting elements of the data as we zoom in for a later article.
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 6.0% and 6.3%, respectively in this diagnostic category. there are some very serious stories to talk about here, but i'll go ahead and point out that covid-19 itself was not categorized among the j-codes.
pregnancy and delivery (icd-10 codes: relevant z-codes; o00-o99)
apologies for not having the dmed queries totals here. i will likely come back and edit this chart later. i was not aware of the missing data when i got started. basically, i outsourced most of the analysis of this category, so i'll have more to say here when i get into higher resolution stories.
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 4.7% and 5.8%, respectively in this diagnostic category. for obvious reasons, there is a great deal of attention on this category. even small changes here can have profound effects on civilization. but for the moment we are staying at medium resolution, and i can't drop hints because the workload has been enough (and this category has been toughest to analyze) that i do not yet have answers.
skin and subcutaneous tissue (icd-10 codes: l00-l99)
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 6.1% and 7.0%, respectively in this diagnostic category.
genitourinary system (icd-10 codes: n00-n99)
those worried about fertility issues should look beyond just the pregnancy category. this is one of the categories with related coding for illness and injury.
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 15.4% and 15.9%, respectively in this diagnostic category. these are extraordinary changes not to be explained in a database, and the importance of this category of disease and illness cannot be understated since it represents systemic risk to national and world populations.
digestive system (icd-10 codes: k00-k95)
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 10.5% and 10.4%, respectively in this diagnostic category. if a rise in the rate of digestive system illness due to spike protein or some other aspect of the experimental covid-19 quasi-vaccines is not intuitive to you (and it wasn't at first to me), watch joshua guetzkow's talk.
infectious and parasitic diseases (icd-10 codes: a00-b99)
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 16.6% and 17.9%, respectively in this highly relevant diagnostic category. there will be a great deal to talk about as we zoom in on these massive upward revisions. but to give a sneak preview, we can see that as the highly vaccinated military moved through their rollout—and especially when the mandates were pushed out in the late summer, covid-19 cases became more severe on average as indicated by hospitalization rates, among military personnel.
rates of several key infectious diseases are exploding, and that will be talked about in depth in another article.
endocrine, nutrition, immunity (icd-10 codes: e00-e89)
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised a whopping 50.3% and 52.5%, respectively in this diagnostic category. we don't even need to drill down to understand the level of hiding massive signals of illness here.
circulatory system (icd-10 codes: i00-i99)
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 13.1% and 13.6%, respectively in this diagnostic category. it will be interesting to drill down to see what safety signals might be hidden by such revisions.
neoplasms (icd-10 codes: c00-d49)
this is the category under which cancers are deposited. the neoplasms are the cancerous growths.
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 12.3% and 14.3%, respectively in this diagnostic category. if these rates were raised to cover up signals from 2021 alone, we're going to see a lot worse, and soon. this is one of the categories i've already explored a bit, but i hope to get a little time asking dr. ryan cole a few questions before i write that article. dr. long's stories have been concerning enough.
hematologic and immune disorders (icd-10 codes: d50-d89)
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 31.6% and 32.7%, respectively in this diagnostic category.
congenital anomalies (icd-10 codes: q00-q99)
the 2016 and 2018 summary ambulatory data were upwardly revised 9.9% and 11.1%, respectively in this diagnostic category. unfortunately, i left this category out of initial analysis, so we're piecing this one together now.
parting thoughts
if the revisions were not intentionally deceiving, the revelation is that enormous amounts of historical data would have been entirely misunderstood by physicians and biomedical researchers and in crucial ways.
a shout out to the team working with me on this project, which includes not only the three whistleblowers (drs. theresa long, samuel sigoloff, and peter chambers), but several volunteers who aren't looking for any spotlight and mostly want to remain anonymous. their courage and humility are felt.
special thanks to drs. heather gessling, ryan cole, richard urso, lynn fynn, mary talley bowden, and ben marble for advice on the next stage of this project that will involve zooming in for higher resolution. in how many ways can these astounding physicians help during all the plandemonium? whenever i've put in effort with the data, these and others have been happy to step up and spend time with me, whether in framing the context of data, or narrowing my search parameters so that i could work more efficiently. after all, there are hundreds of thousands of icd-10 codes.
i'd like to once again thank readers and particularly paid subscribers for their support—particularly during this project. it occurs to me that i passed a one year publishing anniversary (has it been that long?), though still not a one year anniversary for the first paid subscription. for the first couple of months, i didn't know there was a button to turn on paid subscriptions. this wasn't intended to be a full time job, but here we are, and i'm grateful to be able to pay the bills having given up my last business plan as i watched such concerning levels of policy and data fraud unfold on so many levels.

heather elkins, 45, couldn’t get a medical exemption from her employer’s covid-19 vaccine mandate despite a pre-existing heart condition — now she can’t work at all.
miss a day, miss a lot. subscribe to the defender's top news of the day. it's free.
when her employer in 2021 mandated all employees get the covid-19 vaccine, heather elkins, who had a pre-existing heart condition, requested a medical exemption.
but the oregon department of human services turned down her application — even though elkins had transitioned, in 2020, to a permanent work-from-home employee.
elkins told the defender:
“all state of oregon employees were mandated by gov. kate brown to be fully vaccinated from covid-19 or to meet a qualifying exemption regardless of if the employee was working from home or not and if we did not comply, we would lose our job!”
elkins, 45, was reluctant to get the vaccine for several reasons, she said:
“i am by no means against vaccines. with that being said, i was not comfortable with the covid-19 vaccine for a number of reasons. first, i didn’t feel like there was enough known about it and the long-term effects it might have.
“second, i saw reports stating people were developing heart issues, and given that i myself have a heart issue, i wasn’t feeling comfortable with getting the vaccine.”
she added: “it’s my body and the decision should be my choice! i know how my body reacts to trauma, illness, etc. i should be able to choose what goes in it.”
elkins tried every available avenue in her attempt to get an exemption. she told the defender:
“i spoke to management, hr and my union, [service employees international union] seiu, multiple times about how uneasy i felt getting the covid-19 vaccine. i also spoke with my doctors … multiple times about my concerns and asked for a medical exemption. they kept advising me to get the vaccine and stated the ‘reward outweighs the risk.’
“i even contacted my cardiologist … and was transferred to my cardiologist’s nurse, who stated: ‘we are not advising on whether or not you should receive the covid-19 vaccine.’”
elkins said given the vaccines were causing heart issues, she thought her cardiologist, of all people, would be willing to weigh in.
“that wasn’t the case here, she said. “they turned a blind eye.”
after she ran out of options — including not meeting the requirements for a religious exemption, either — elkins was forced to choose between the vaccine and her job.
symptoms occurred ‘within an hour’ of first pfizer shot
elkins got the pfizer vaccine on sept. 12, 2021, and “within about an hour,” she said, began experiencing adverse reactions.
the reactions she experienced after the first shot didn’t qualify her for a medical exemption from the second shot, she said:
“i even asked for a medical exemption from the second dose of the vaccine after several visits to the doctor for severe symptoms after receiving the first dose of pfizer.
“i was told that they were not giving medical exemptions because the ‘reward outweighs the risk.’”
so despite continued efforts to secure a medical exemption, elkins received her second pfizer shot on oct. 3, 2021, and experienced “the same severe reaction as with the first dose.”
the symptoms included “severe headache[s], severe muscle aches, [a] racing heartbeat … nausea, severe fatigue and dizziness/balance issues, chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath [and] a severe cough,” she said.
a year later, elkins continues to experience symptoms that affect her ability to work.
elkins told the defender:
“to date, i’m experiencing all the same issues in addition to other symptoms like brain fog, horrible joint pain, pins and needles sensations, painful nerve zaps, shakiness and tremors in my hands and feet, and vision issues.
“at times, some of the symptoms are worse than others, but the symptoms as a whole have been so debilitating daily, i eventually couldn’t continue working and have had to go on workman’s compensation for now.”
prior to getting the vaccines, elkins said she was “living a normal life, walking and jogging several times a week for exercise and living a normal life.”
but now, she said, “i’ve now been mostly confined to my bed for the last 11 months, unable to do minimal activities because of my debilitating symptoms,” she said. “tasks that seemed easy before, like working on crafts, doing the dishes, cooking or a trip to the store is physically exhausting and my symptoms are overwhelming.”
after visiting a succession of doctors — including her primary physician, a covid-19 recovery specialist, a physical therapist, a speech therapist, a cardiologist, a pulmonologist, a rheumatologist, a neurologist and an ophthalmologist — elkins was diagnosed with dysautonomia, a condition characterized by a malfunctioning autonomic nervous system, she said.
“most of the doctors i’ve seen think i’m having some kind of immune response to the vaccine but don’t know why or how to stop it because so little is known.”
she’s tried a variety of medications and treatments, including physical therapy, speech therapy, a clean diet and even celery juice, but “none of them seem to be helping,” elkins said.
“the pulmonologist has me on a steroid inhaler which helps so long as i’m not having long conversations or exerting myself.
she added:
“i have no personal life because every time i try to leave home and do anything social, my symptoms are exacerbated. i spend most of my days in bed. and on good days, i make it out to the living room to rest in a recliner.”
although she was unable to secure a medical exemption for her first or second doses, elkins said that she has “now been told i can have an exemption from the booster” — but only after “multiple visits with multiple doctors,” who told her that the reaction she experienced “is severe.”
elkins said her primary doctor “has since apologized to me verbally for not listening to my concerns when i asked for the medical exemption.”
though too late to help elkins, her employer subsequently removed the mandate, “at the same time they were doing a big hiring push for new employees,” she said.
government ‘sweeping it under the rug, like it isn’t real’
though friends and family have provided some support, they don’t fully understand what she’s experiencing, elkins said.
“either they are supportive quiet, or just try to explain away the reason for my symptoms such as… ‘maybe the vaccine exacerbated a condition you already had that you didn’t know about or that was dormant.’”
elkins, who said she knows “with 100% certainty that i was healthy prior to the covid-19 vaccine,” has found a greater level of support through online support groups for vaccine-injured groups — including the vaccine injury/side effects support group, real not rare and react19.
“they’ve all been a wealth of information,” she said.
even though “it’s sad to hear the stories being shared,” elkins said, “it’s comforting to know that others understand and know what it’s like to go through what you are [going through]. these side effects are debilitating and it is very easy to become depressed, even if you’re someone like me who has never really experienced that in the past.”
she said the people in these support groups are “vital” to healing. “not only are we able to relate to one another, but these ‘perfect strangers’ understand in ways your closest family members and friends can’t.”
elkins hopes these groups — and the vaccine-injured individuals who are speaking out — will translate to pressure on governmental authorities.
“our government needs to take accountability for the lack of transparency with the covid-19 vaccines,” said elkins. “their lack of transparency and shadiness surrounding adverse reactions is hurting so many, but they just continue sweeping it under the rug like it isn’t real or happening.”

https://www.foxnews.com/us/pentagon-rushed-deny-service-members-vaccine-religious-exemption-requests-report
a pentagon report found the military was likely too quick to deny service members religious exemptions to its covid-19 vaccine mandate.
"we found a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by federal law and dod and military service policies," pentagon inspector general sean o'donnell wrote in a memo to defense secretary lloyd austin in june, according to military.com. "some of the appellate decisions included documentation that demonstrated a greater consideration of facts and circumstances involved in a request."
thousands of service members filed for religious exemptions to the covid-19 vaccine after it was mandated by austin in august 2021, but only a fraction of those who made the requests were approved.
members of congress demand answers from austin over 'blanket denial' of religious vaccine accommodations
the military mandates vaccinations and medical treatments for a variety of illnesses, including flu and smallpox. service members can be excused from those treatments only with an approved religious exemption, but the inspector general found the process for denying such requests for the covid-19 vaccine revealed "concerning" trends.
marine corps rescinds penalties for service members seeking covid vax religious accommodations
"the volume and rate at which decisions were made to deny requests is concerning," the memo to austin said. "assuming a 10-hour work day with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes for each package. such a review period seems insufficient to process each request in an individualized manner and still perform the duties required of their position."
a group of gop lawmakers on monday demanded answers from austin on what they called "blanket denial of religious accommodation" in response to the memo.

"as of february 2022, the department of the navy had granted only a single, partial exemption to its covid-19 vaccine mandate on religious grounds, and as of july 2022 the department of the u.s. army had approved just 20 of over 8,000 requests, the department of the air force had approved less than 130 of over 9,000 requests, and the u.s. marines had only approved seven of over 3,700 requests," said the group, which was led by republican reps. jim banks of indiana and darrell issa of california.
the pentagon did not immediately respond to a fox news' request for comment.

https://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/Immunization-Healthcare/Clinical-Consultation-Services/Exemption-Guidance
vaccination programs are important to military public health and readiness. sometimes, however, an individual may be considered exempt from a particular vaccination. there are two general types of vaccine exemptions: medical and administrative. a medical exemption may be validated by a health care professional. an administrative exemption is a non-medical function that may be considered by an individual's command or employer.
where can i get more information?
for general guidance, please see the joint instruction (ar 40-562, bumedinst 6230.15b, afi 48-110_ip, cg comdtinst m6230.4g) immunizations and chemoprophylaxis for prevention of infectious disease.
health care professionals may be consulted regarding medical exemption recommendations. both health care professionals and service members may contact the dha immunization healthcare support center at 877-438-8222 (dsn 761-4245), option 1, for vaccine medical exemption guidance.
what are the different types of military exemptions?
medical
temporary exemptions* may be granted for brief periods of time, no longer than 365 days, based on: temporary conditions (e.g., acute illness or, for some vaccines, pregnancy or certain medications may prompt deferral of vaccination to a later time) pending completion of an ongoing medical evaluation that would affect a vaccine decision temporary challenges with vaccine supply
permanent exemptions* may be granted indefinitely based on: contraindication to a specific vaccine, as defined by the centers for disease control and prevention advisory committee on immunization practices (cdc acip) and/or a determination by a medical provider that vaccination will seriously endanger a patient's health "medical, reactive" exemption may be based on previous severe reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a specific vaccine "medical, immune" exemption may be based on evidence of existing immunity to a vaccine-preventable infection. note: cdc acip defines which vaccine-preventable infections are applicable to this kind of vaccine exemption. for example, a history of laboratory-confirmed measles or a blood test (serology) demonstrating measles antibodies is considered by cdc acip to meet the criteria for measles immunity; exemption from measles vaccine may apply to patients meeting these criteria. there are many vaccine-preventable infections (e.g., influenza and many others) for which cdc acip has determined that history of prior infection or serologic testing cannot be used to define immunity; vaccine exemptions are not appropriate in these cases.
* medical exemptions, either temporary or permanent, may be revoked based on changes in infection risk, immunization options, or other changes that impact risk-benefit decisions..
administrative
planned separation or retirement within 180 days, provided the following conditions are met: service member is not assigned, deployed or scheduled to perform duties in an area where specific immunization is indicated the commander has not directed immunization because of overriding mission requirements
religious: granted according to service-specific policies command decisions may be made with medical, judge advocate and/or chaplain consultation
how is an exemption documented?
electronic and paper health records must annotate temporary and/or permanent medical exemptions.
all exemptions, administrative or medical, must be documented in the immunization section and clinical notes of individual medical records. for military members, exemptions must also be documented in readiness systems (navy/marine corps/coast guard medical readiness reporting system, army medical protection system, or air force aeromedical services information management system).
what happens when patients disagree with an exemption decision?
each military service has a process to review concerns about vaccine exemption decisions specific to covid-19 vaccines. military members should follow guidance from their chain of command for appealing an exemption decision. federal civilian employees should work within their respective commands to appeal decisions about vaccine exemption. healthcare providers who have clinical questions about whether or when to authorize medical exemptions from vaccination may consult directly with specialists, including the dha immunization healthcare support center clinical team.

this timing is critical as children head back to school and the cdc has signed off on two new boosters that take aim at the stubborn omicron subvariants. cardiologist dr. keith newby has been on the front lines of the pandemic from the beginning. he says because of the long-haul symptoms associated with covid infections, he encourages all who qualify to get booster shots as soon as possible.
” we’re seeing these complication rates of increased shortness of breath and long-term mental fog. in fact, i have been an advocate for vaccinating people, period, i don’t care what their age is because i have seen in real-time people with these long-term complications,” said dr. newby.
norfolk economic development spokesperson mia byrd said in addition to covid-19 vaccines, monkeypox vaccines will be available at the facility inside the former macy’s.
those free shots will be offered beginning september 12 on mondays and wednesdays from 2 p.m. until 6 p.m. byrd said they expect to provide the monkeypox vaccinations through october.

https://fox40.com/news/political-connection/house-passes-stopgap-bill-to-prevent-shutdown/
this is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.
(the hill) — the house on tuesday passed a stopgap measure to extend federal government funding until march 11 to prevent a shutdown next week while negotiations over a longer-term package remain ongoing.
the chamber voted 272-162 to pass the short-term funding bill on tuesday evening, just one day before the house is set to be out of session until the week of feb. 28. a total of 51 house republicans joined all but one democrat in support of the measure.
the senate is expected to act swiftly on the legislation. senate majority leader charles schumer (d-n.y.) said tuesday that he intends for the upper chamber to “take it up quickly and in time” before current government funding expires next friday, feb. 18.
the legislation buys congressional negotiators on both sides of the aisle time to strike a larger spending deal known as an omnibus to fund government operations for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends in late september.
if passed by the house and senate, the continuing resolution will mark the third time congress has had to resort to such measures to prevent a shutdown for the current fiscal year that began oct. 1, as lawmakers struggle to reach a bipartisan agreement on spending.
the house, where democrats hold the majority, has so far passed 9 out of 12 of its annual appropriations bills. but none have passed in the 50-50 split senate, where democrats would need the support of all the party’s members and 10 republican votes to pass such legislation.
leaders on both sides of the aisle have their sights set on securing a deal on a massive omnibus spending package for fiscal 2022, but disagreements in major areas, including defense and nondefense spending, as well as policy riders, have slowed efforts.
sen. richard shelby (r-ala.), the ranking republican on senate appropriations committee, told reporters on tuesday that leaders have continued to meet and have been trading spending offers.
“we’re close,” shelby said, though he added leaders are “not there” yet.
congressional appropriators have also bemoaned the lack of an agreement on an overall topline number as spending talks drag out, making it difficult for those charged with helping craft spending legislation to complete their work.
“what’s preventing us from getting a deal is a lack of agreement on top lines … because once you get top lines, then you are then you have all of these complicated issues within each subcommittee,” sen. chris murphy (d-conn.), who chairs the appropriations subcommittee on homeland security, told the hill.
rep. kay granger (r-texas), top ranking member on the house appropriations committee, told reporters on monday that she’s “hopeful” she and other leading negotiators will come to a topline agreement later this week.
house appropriations committee chairwoman rosa delauro (d-conn.) also said on the floor on tuesday afternoon that she believes leaders are “very close” to an agreement on spending, adding she is “eager to move this process forward.”
“i have every expectation that we can finalize a framework in short order, and then work together to fill in the details and enact an omnibus,” she said.
the last effort to swiftly pass a stopgap measure to prevent a shutdown in december ran into resistance from republicans who vowed to oppose any spending bill that would implement the biden administration’s covid-19 vaccine mandates.
those republicans ultimately relented to allow a swift vote to prevent a government shutdown after they secured a vote on amendment to prevent enforcement of the vaccine mandate for large businesses.
since then, the supreme court last month blocked the biden administration’s vaccine-or-test mandate for large employers. but the court did allow a vaccine mandate for health providers at federally funded facilities to stand.
nearly 50 republicans in the house and senate signed a letter last week led by rep. chip roy (r-texas) vowing to oppose any federal spending bill that funds the enforcement of covid-19 vaccine mandates “at any level of government.”
at least 10 senate republicans will have to join with democrats to advance the stopgap measure when it reaches the upper chamber. but only four gop senators — sens. mike lee (utah), rand paul (ky.), ron johnson (wis.) and ted cruz (texas) — have signed onto the pledge to oppose any funding that allows implementation of vaccine mandates.

share comment on this story comment
on aug. 30, 1954, bernice e. eddy, a veteran scientist at the national institutes of health in bethesda, md., was checking a batch of a new polio vaccine for safety. created by jonas salk, the vaccine was hailed as the miracle drug that would conquer the dreaded illness that killed and paralyzed children. eddy’s job was to examine samples submitted by the companies planning to make it.
as she checked a sample from cutter laboratories in berkeley, calif., she noticed that the vaccine designed to protect against the disease had instead given polio to a test monkey. rather than containing killed virus to create immunity, the sample from cutter contained live, infectious virus.
something was wrong. “there’s going to be a disaster,” she told a friend.
as scientists and politicians desperately search for medicines to slow the deadly coronavirus, and as president trump touts a malaria drug as a remedy, a look back to the 1955 polio vaccine tragedy shows how hazardous such a search can be, especially under intense public pressure.
despite eddy’s warnings, an estimated 120,000 children that year were injected with the cutter vaccine, according to paul a. offit, director of the vaccine education center at children’s hospital of philadelphia.

roughly 40,000 got “abortive” polio, with fever, sore throat, headache, vomiting and muscle pain. fifty-one were paralyzed, and five died, offit wrote in his 2005 book, “the cutter incident: how america’s first polio vaccine led to the growing vaccine crisis.”
it was “one of the worst biological disasters in american history: a man-made polio epidemic,” offit wrote.
in those days, polio, or infantile paralysis, was a terror.
“a national poll … found that polio was second only to the atomic bomb as the thing that americans feared most,” offit wrote.
“people weren’t sure how you got it,” he said in an interview last week. “therefore, they were scared of everything. they didn’t want to buy a piece of fruit at the grocery store. it’s the same now. … everybody’s walking around with gloves on, with masks on, scared to shake anybody’s hand.”
advertisement
“i remember my mother … wouldn’t let us go to a public swimming pool,” said offit, 69. we “all had to go into one of those little plastic pools in the back so that we wouldn’t be in a public place.”
the worst polio outbreak in u.s. history struck in 1952, the year after offit was born. it infected 57,000 people, paralyzed 21,000 and killed 3,145. the next year there were 35,000 infections, and 38,000 the year after that.
many survivors had to wear painful metal braces on their paralyzed legs or had to be placed in so-called iron lungs, which helped them breathe. there was no vaccine and few treatments. (one bogus approach was to spray acid into the noses of children to block the virus. all it did was ruin the sense of smell.)
often polio victims were children, but the most famous affected american was president franklin d. roosevelt, who got polio and was paralyzed from the waist down in 1921 when he was 39.
advertisement
in 1951, jonas salk of the university of pittsburgh’s medical school received a grant from the national foundation for infantile paralysis to find a vaccine. during intense months of research, he took live polio virus and killed it with formaldehyde until it was not infectious but still provided virus-fighting antibodies.
when tests showed that the vaccine was safe, salk told his wife, “i’ve got it,” offit wrote.
word of his success soon leaked out. public pressure grew for the vaccine and for a large-scale trial.
in 1953, salk tested it on himself, his wife and three children.
on april 26, 1954, randy kerr, a 6-year-old second-grader from falls church, va., stood in the cafeteria of the franklin sherman elementary school in mclean and became the first to be vaccinated in a massive field study.
advertisement
salk’s vaccine was given to 420,000 children. a placebo was given to 200,000. and 1.2 million were given nothing.
the study found that children who did not get the vaccine were three times more likely to be paralyzed with polio than those who received the vaccine.
a year later, on april 12, 1955, when officials announced the results at a news conference at the university of michigan, there was jubilation. reporters hollered: “it works! it works!” offit wrote.
the news made front-page headlines across the country. “people wept,” offit said. “there were parades in jonas salk’s honor. … that’s what contributed to the tragedy of cutter more than anything else … the irony.”
that same day, licenses were hurriedly granted to several drug companies, including cutter laboratories, to make the vaccine.
but the officials granting the licenses were never told of eddy’s findings, offit wrote.

the year before, eddy’s scrutiny of the cutter vaccine had continued through the summer and fall.

it must have been a difficult time. she was 52. her husband, jerald guy wooley, 64, a fellow national institutes of health scientist, had died suddenly the previous april, leaving her with three daughters, two of them still at home in bethesda, according to his obituary. her mother moved in to help out.
eddy was born in 1903 in glen dale, w.va., a small town on the ohio river, south of wheeling, according to a 1985 biographical sketch by elizabeth moot o’hern. her father was a doctor.
she had started at nih in 1937, had headed testing of vaccines for influenza, and in 1954 was asked to help test the salk polio vaccine. the pressure was intense. “for weeks she and her staff worked around-the-clock, seven days a week,” o’hern wrote.

“this was a product that had never been made before, and they were going to use it right away,” eddy had said.
she began testing cutter’s samples in august 1954 and continued through november, according to a later report in the congressional record. she found that three of the six samples paralyzed test monkeys.
“what do you think is wrong with these monkeys?” she asked a colleague, offit recounted.
“they were given polio,” the colleague replied.
“no,” eddy said. “they were given the … vaccine.”
eddy’s discovery suggested that cutter’s manufacturing process was flawed. its vaccine should have contained only killed virus.
she reported her findings to william workman, head of the nih laboratory of biologics control.
but amid the scientific and bureaucratic chaos, workman never told the licensing committee, offit wrote.
advertisement
starting on the evening of april 12, 1955, batches of the salk vaccine made by five drug firms were shipped out in boxes marked “polio vaccine: rush.”
about 165,000 doses of cutter’s went out.
within weeks, reports of mysterious polio infections started coming in.
on april 27, 7-year-old susan pierce, of pocatello, idaho, died of polio days after getting the cutter vaccine. she had been placed in an iron lung just before she died. her brother kenneth had been vaccinated at the same time, but he was okay.
other cases followed.
alton ochsner, a professor of surgery at tulane medical school and founder of the ochsner clinic in new orleans, gave the vaccine to his grandson eugene davis, offit wrote. the child died may 4.
not only did some people injected with the tainted vaccine get sick, but some who got the vaccine went on to infect family members and neighbors.

on june 5, 1955, 33-year-old annabelle nelson of montpelier, idaho, died of polio after her two children had been given the vaccine in april, according to news reports at the time.
the government ordered the cutter vaccine withdrawn on april 27. but damage had been done.
“by april 30, within forty-eight hours of the recall,” offit wrote. “cutter’s vaccine had paralyzed or killed twenty-five children: fourteen in california, seven in idaho, two in washington, one in illinois, and one in colorado.”
on may 6, all polio vaccinations were postponed. they were resumed on may 15 after the government had rechecked the vaccines for safety. but people were still frightened.
offit recalled his mother asking their doctor: “what’s the story? should we be getting this vaccine or not?"
eventually, he was vaccinated when he was about 6 years old.
years later, in a suit brought against cutter, the firm was found not negligent in making its vaccine because it had done its best making a new drug that was complicated to produce.
but it was found financially liable for the calamity it had caused during that spring of 1955.
the jury foreman said: “cutter laboratories [brought] to market a … vaccine which when given to plaintiffs caused them to come down with polio.”

https://technofog.substack.com/p/our-woke-military-trans-rights-over
the military is waging a two-front war on its most conservative members.
on one front is the foolish and otherwise unlawful implementation and execution of the armed services’ covid-19 vaccine mandate. religious accommodation requests to the vaccines have been categorically denied by the military branches. as of february of this year, 25,000 service members have requested the military accommodate their request to forego vaccination in light of their sincerely-held religious beliefs. less than 10 had been approved, with zero approvals in the army and navy.
according to one court, “the air force's process to protect religious rights is both illusory and insincere. in short, it’s just ‘theater.’” another court found the military actively disfavoring religious exemptions: “the mandate treats those with secular exemptions more favorably than those seeking religious exemptions.” in other words, the military is openly and proudly hostile to religious service members, forcing them under threat of punishment to choose the vaccines over their faith.
as to the mandate’s implementation generally, the military doesn’t recognize natural immunity. we all know that natural immunity is robust and long-lasting. certainly more so than that of the vaccines. the dod, led by secretary austin, chooses to ignore this data in favor mandatory vaccination for all.
then there is the unlawful required administration of vaccines authorized under an emergency use authorization (eua), since the officially “licensed” vaccines remain unavailable. what makes that unlawful? the president must authorize the administration of eua vaccines to the military – and he hasn’t.
the other front, related to the first, involves the culture generally. back in 2017, there were reports that army training allowed for male soldiers identifying as women to wash in female showers. units were to adjust to transgender identity. this issue reappeared this week, with reporting from the washington free beacon providing source documents of the army’s transgender service policy which states:
“gender transition in the army begins when a soldier receives a diagnosis from a military medical provider indicating that gender transition is medically necessary.”
this comes after the military’s celebration of pride month this past june, and west point cadets being taught critical race theory – including this slide on “whiteness.”
in the face of this evidence, secretary of defense lloyd austin maintains the dod is “apolitical.” joint chiefs of staff chair gen. mark milley declares the u.s. military is an “apolitical institution.”
yet it’s easy to see which groups the current regime favors. they’re not being subtle about it. trans soldiers are given wide latitude to exercise their gender identity. the pious are discharged. sexual identity is celebrated. white skin color is condemned as original sin. (maybe i should say both sides are pious. they just worship different gods/gods.)
in the midst of all this, or more accurately – because of all this – “every branch of the u.s. military is struggling to meet its fiscal year 2022 recruiting goals.” according to data obtained by nbc news, there is “both a record low percentage of young americans eligible to serve and an even tinier fraction willing to consider it.”
why the drop? rod dreher, discussing jeff groom’s article in the spectator, references the point of view of the recruited, saying:
“at some point, you’ve got to realize that it’s a scam, that you are being asked to risk your life to fight for an imperial order that thinks your law-abiding, church-going, palefaced right-wing self is the problem with america.”
we observe that what was once imperialism is now imperialism with progressivism on top. it has the same appetite for power and dominance – and it will continue to satisfy that appetite through deceit – but at least it will do so in a progressive manner. cue the memes.
not that we should be surprised by this. the institutional disregard of the lives of the military service members has been an undisputed fact for years. the us government prioritized the war effort and corporate profits when it covered-up the deadly effects of agent orange during the vietnam war. in the 1980s, the cdc continued the cover-up, lying about military records and the link between birth defects and agent orange.
in the more recent past, we lost approximately 2,450 american service members and spent over $2 trillion in afghanistan. lies from military leadership kept america in that war, undoubtedly leading to the death of thousands of americans and untold amounts of money. those promises from u.s. generals about progress? the data points were “altered” to paint a picture of success that wasn’t true. how were they not complicit in the deaths of american troops?
i ask that question to reframe the issue. mandates and woke politics are the current dilemma. but it’s all manifested from rot that has been persistent deep in the military’s bones. at least we’re now seeing it for what it is.

dod edits medical database to hide military covid-19 vaccine injuries as u.s. military is decimated by the mandatory shots
% of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents.
by brian shilhavy
editor, health impact news
lt. col. peter chambers has a 38-year career in the military. he is a green beret commander having served in the special forces, and he is a military doctor, serving as a flight surgeon and combat medic. he has earned the purple heart and bronze star medal, as well as other military awards for his service.
lt. col. peter chambers became a whistleblower after suffering neurological issues following mandatory covid-19 vaccines, and seeing similar vaccine injuries in other soldiers, including: strokes, blood clots, cerebral bleeding, and various neurological injuries.
he began to research vaccine injuries following the covid-19 vaccines that were mandated for service members, in the defense medical epidemiology database (dmed) sponsored by the dod.
he has most recently been deployed in texas, near the texas-mexico border as a task force surgeon, where he began to provide “informed consent” counseling to over 3000 soldiers at the border regarding the covid-19 vaccines, sharing with them the data he had uncovered in dmed, vaers, nih and other government sources.
being in texas, he also informed them that doctors could prescribe early treatments for covid, such as ivermectin, which are very effective in overcoming the symptoms associated with covid-19.
as a result, only 6 service members out of 3000 decided to comply with the covid-19 vaccine mandates.
dr. chambers was approached by a 2-star general who asked why his vaccination rates were so low, to which he replied:
sir, we have a regulation, ar 40-562 chapter 8 paragraph 4, clearly states that under emergency use authorization, i must do informed consent. it’s a regulation. sir, i do things legally, morally, ethically, and first of all “do no harm.”
the general allegedly became very angry with dr. chambers and stated:
you will cease and desist giving those informed consents.
dr. chambers looked at him straight in the eye and replied:
sir, that is an unlawful order, and i will not follow that order.
the general then allegedly fired him on the spot, and dr. chambers’ military career was basically over at that point.
dr. chambers replied:
ok. but sir, i am the only medical doctor down here on the border. do you have anybody else? we’re getting shot at once in a while, you know that, i am a combat trauma doctor, and i’ve stopped a lot of bleeding.
after informing the general that he had filed a whistleblower complaint, the general did some checking, and about an hour later stated that dr. chambers was not fired, but that he would be replaced.
dr. chambers had joined dr. theresa long, another military doctor who is also a flight surgeon, in a lawsuit filed by attorney thomas renz against the u.s. military’s mandatory covid-19 vaccination program.
listen to the whole interview between dr. chambers and steve kirsch recorded back in march of this year. it is 21 minutes long, and well worth the time to watch!
at the end of this interview, dr. chambers stated: “if we don’t stop this, our military is going to be decimated.”
within a day or two of this interview, their whistleblower case reached the u.s. supreme court which ruled 6-3 against navy seals being entitled to a religious exemption for covid-19 vaccine mandates.
at the same time, new york city mayor eric adams issued an executive order that exempted professional sports players and the entertainment industry from having to comply with covid-19 vaccine mandates. see:
insanity is the new norm in the u.s. as professional sports players can be exempt from covid vaccine mandates but navy seals cannot
now, just the news is reporting that dr. chambers and other military medical doctor whistleblowers can no longer depend upon the data in dmed because “[the] dod took down, edited and restored the defense medical epidemiology database earlier this year after whistleblowers including chambers testified on the reported spike (in vaccine injuries) in a legal challenge.”
the department told politifact …. the 2021 spike was the product of a “glitch” that caused severe underreporting of 2016-2020 figures. that would mean the military underreported cases by about 20 million a year during that period, whistleblower lawyer tom renz said. chambers told just the news that dmed used to be more trustworthy than the government’s vaccine adverse events reporting system but now it’s “completely unusable” because dod changed many diagnoses that suggested vaccine injury after the military doctors went public. working on the border with the texas national guard, he personally observed highly unusual problems in “a healthy population that should not be seeing these things,” from myocarditis to “brain bleeds,” and continues to receive similar reports in his “retirement section.” chambers said he developed demyelination after getting the moderna vaccine in january 2021, which led him and lt. col. theresa long, another whistleblower, to review dmed. he has more freedom to speak than long, who was supposed to testify alongside chambers until her commander gagged her from discussing dmed data the night before the hearing, long would face prosecution, jail time and dishonorable discharge for ignoring a direct order even if she later overturned the gag, according to chambers, describing long’s command as “vitriolic.” she didn’t respond to queries. chambers, long and lawyer renz joined a group letter to the federal aviation administration in december, demanding the medical “flagging” of all covid vaccinated pilots and their testing for heart problems. they alleged federal law prohibits commercial airline pilots who had taken emergency use authorization vaccines from flying, and imposes a 12-month observational grounding for newly approved vaccines such as pfizer’s comirnaty. after vaccinated pilot robert snow suffered cardiac arrest shortly after landing an american airlines flight, anti-mandate pilots group u.s. freedom flyers accused the faa of ignoring the risk to flights from such adverse events.

is our military healthy enough to defend our country?
navy seals. image source.
it appears to be a forgone conclusion now that our military is “being decimated” by covid-19 vaccine injuries, just as dr. chambers stated back in march, at the same time that the current administration is picking fights with russia over ukraine, and china over taiwan.
what happens next? will a foreign force or perhaps a un force be able to just annex the united states and take over our government without even having to fire a shot?
are there still enough soldiers left in our armed forces to repel a foreign invasion? are there enough local militia groups and honest law enforcement, such as constitutional sheriffs, left to defend our neighborhoods?
we are most certainly living through some very dark times now, and the vast majority of the public is still clueless to the real dangers we now face, and that appear to be imminent.
what is currently happening in china to the people living there should be a real wake-up call to the types of measures that the globalists want to implement here.

the pentagon announced that all active-duty service members will have to be vaccinated against covid-19. the announcement comes on the same day the u.s. food and drug administration granted full approval to pfizer's mrna vaccine.
"we're going to move forward, making that vaccine mandatory. we're preparing the guidance to the force right now. and the actual completion date of it, in other words, how fast we want to see it get done, we're working through that guidance right now," pentagon press secretary john kirby said during a press conference.
earlier in the month, defense secretary lloyd austin announced that he asked president joe biden to grant a waiver to add the covid vaccines to a list of required immunizations for service members. now that the pfizer vaccine has been fully approved by the fda, the pentagon does not need a waiver from president biden to require troops to get vaccinated.
kirby refused to comment on the moderna vaccine, which is still being distributed under an emergency use authorization by the fda.
"i don't want to get ahead of decisions that haven't been made yet," he said.
the requirement would apply to roughly 1.3 million service members. as of august 18, just over one million service members have been fully vaccinated, and nearly 245,000 have received at one dose. there have been over 220,000 cases of covid in the armed forces, and 34 troops have died since the start of the global pandemic.

solid tumor diagnosed after vax
new aggressive cancers are killing people soon after covid vax…including children.
13 yo f. 1 month after pf vax, had vague upper back pain. over the next 6 weeks, she developed fatigue, chest pain, sore throat and cough. all viral workup was negative and was treated for pneumonia. by 8 weeks after vax, she developed increased heart rate and symptoms worsened. she was found to have fluid around her heart. this was drained and shown to have heart muscle cancer cells. over the next 30 days, she grew a massive tumor inside the left atrium of her heart. it continued to grow rapidly despite aggressive chemotherapy and the child died less than 1 month later. vaers id 1913198
death—73 year old male diagnosed with liver cancer 13 days after vax, that metastasized to the lungs and lymphatics a month later. liver cancer doubled in size 13 days after that.
healthy 53 yo f from az. normal screening mammogram 2mo after moderna vax. 4 months later, diagnosed with “a very aggressive inflammatory breast cancer.” began chemo. “we are a small rural facility serving a relatively closed population and such cases are very rare but i have noted several since the spring. will be reporting others also.” vaers id 1684985
another report from same provider above: 42 yo f. normal mammogram 1.5 yrs prior. 4 months after pfizer vax, noticed breast lump near areola (same location as previous case). biopsy the next month showed “aggressive triple + (node +) infiltrating breast cancer.” vaers id 1685076

washington (ap) — four cadets at the air force academy may not graduate or be commissioned as military officers this month because they have refused the covid-19 vaccine, and they may be required to pay back thousands of dollars in tuition costs, according to air force officials.
it’s the only military academy, so far, where cadets may face such penalties. the army and navy said that as of now, not one of their seniors is being prevented from graduating at the u.s. military academy at west point, new york, or the naval academy in annapolis, maryland, due to vaccine refusals. the graduations are in about two weeks.
defense secretary lloyd austin last year made the covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members, including those at the military academies, saying the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force.
military leaders have argued that troops for decades have been required to get as many as 17 vaccines in order to maintain the health of the force, particularly those deploying overseas. students arriving at the military academies get a regimen of shots on their first day — such as measles, mumps and rubella – if they aren’t already vaccinated. and they routinely get regular flu shots in the fall.
members of congress, the military and the public have questioned if the exemption reviews by the military services have been fair. there have been multiple lawsuits filed against the mandate, mainly centering on the fact that very few service members have been granted religious exemptions from the shots.
until the covid-19 vaccine, very few military members sought religious exemptions to any vaccines.
lt. col. brian maguire, an air force academy spokesman, said that while vaccination status may hinder the graduation of the four seniors, “there are still two weeks until graduation, so their status could change as the cadets weigh their options.”
according to maguire, the four cadets — who are not named — have been informed of the potential consequences, and have met with the academy’s superintendent. in addition to those four, there are two juniors, one sophomore and six freshmen at the academy who have also refused the vaccine.
the military academies for years have required students under certain circumstances to repay tuition costs if they leave during their junior or senior year. often those involve students with disciplinary issues or similar problems. the costs can be as much as $200,000, or more, and any final decision on repayment is made by the service secretary.
west point said that there are no members of the class of 2022 who have refused to get the vaccine.
across the military, the army, navy, air force and marine corps have discharged nearly 4,000 active duty service members for refusing the vaccine. according to recent data released by the services, more than 2,100 marines, 900 sailors, 500 army soldiers and 360 airmen have been thrown out of the military, and at least 50 were discharged during entry level training, before they moved into active duty service.
those who flatly refuse the vaccine without seeking an exemption are still being discharged. but the courts have stalled additional discharges of service members who sought religious exemptions.
last month, a federal judge in texas barred the navy from taking action for now against sailors who have objected to being vaccinated on religious grounds.
u.s. district judge reed o’connor had, in january, issued a preliminary injunction preventing the navy from disciplining or discharging 35 sailors who sued over the navy’s vaccine policy while their case played out. in april, o’connor agreed the case could go forward as a class action suit and issued a preliminary injunction covering about 4,000 sailors who have objected on religious grounds to being vaccinated.
also last month, a federal judge in ohio granted a preliminary injunction blocking the air force from disciplining a dozen officers and some additional airmen and reservists who were seeking religious exemptions. the officers, mostly from wright-patterson air force base near dayton, ohio, sued in february after their exemption requests were denied.
according to the military, as many as 20,000 service members have asked for religious exemptions. thousands have been denied.
as of recent data, the air force has approved 73 religious exemptions, the marine corps has approved seven, and the army has approved eight. before the injunction, the navy conditionally approved one reservist and 26 active-duty requests for religious exemptions, and 10 requests from members of the individual ready reserve. the irr approvals mean that those sailors don’t have to be vaccinated until they are actually called to serve.
about 99% of the active duty navy and 98% of the air force, marine corps and army have gotten at least one shot.

a federal judge in ohio blocked the air force’s plan to expel thousands of unvaccinated service members and enforcing the vaccine requirement against covid-19 on thursday.
american military news reported that trump-appointed judge matthew w. mcfarland of ohio’s southern district granted a temporary restraining order after service members sued the air force secretary to provide religious exemptions to the covid-19 vaccine mandate.
“mcfarland’s ruling grants class status in a class action lawsuit to airmen, space force guardians, air national guardsmen and air force academy and air force reserve officer training corps (afrotc) cadets who submitted a religious accommodation request for the vaccine mandate from sept. 1, 2021, to the present, and who were confirmed by an air force chaplain as having had a sincerely held religious belief, and who either had their requests denied or still-pending accommodations,” the news outlet reported.
“the court issues a temporary restraining order prohibiting defendants from enforcing the vaccine mandate against any class member, to expire 14 days from the entry of this order,” mcfarland wrote in his ruling.
judge mcfarland ordered the defendants to write a 10-page supplemental brief by july 21, 2022, explaining why he should not extend the temporary restraining order.
back in april, judge matthew mcfarland granted an order to block the military temporarily from disciplining 18 u.s. air force officers, airmen, and reservists, including 11 who currently or recently served at wright-patterson in dayton, until their lawsuit is resolved.
more from american military news:
as of the air force’s latest vaccination statistics posted tuesday, 6,803 members were denied religious accommodation requests, while 2,847 requests remain pending, and only 104 were approved. approximately 2.9% of the air force’s entire ranks remain unvaccinated. the service has already kicked out 834 members. mat staver, the founder and chairman of liberty counsel — a religious freedom organization that has been supporting the air force plaintiffs in their lawsuit — said, “this is a great decision that grants protection for the religious freedom for all air force personnel from joe biden’s unlawful covid shot mandate.” “no service member should be required to choose between service to the country and service to god. liberty counsel will be pursuing class-wide protection for the remaining branches of the military,” staver added. daniel schmid, an attorney for liberty counsel, told american military news that liberty counsel is aware of service members within the lawsuit class who have begun to receive their separation packages but that no service members in the class have hit their separation dates and that the judge’s order will pause those separations for now. schmid also said mcfarland’s decision to grant a temporary restraining order is an indicator that the plaintiffs can expect him to grant a longer preliminary injunction soon that could last for the duration of their lawsuit against the air force.
the gateway pundit reported earlier this month that the united states air force began issuing its first cuts, including a highly-decorated, 19-year veteran master sergeant named nick kupper.
in an appearance with tucker carlson on wednesday, kupper blasted biden’s “illegal” mandates and warned that tens of thousands of other military members are facing the same fate for refusing the vaccine – unbelievably, as much as 10% of the entire us military could get the ax, according to kupper.

a federal appeals court on feb. 28 rejected an attempt by president joe biden's administration to partially lift a block on the military's covid-19 vaccine mandate for a group of navy seals.
a federal judge in january blocked the mandate's enforcement for 35 navy members, many of them seals, ruling that while the navy had provided a process for adjudicating religious exemption applications, “by all accounts, it is theater.”
at the time of the ruling, the navy had granted zero religious exemptions. as of feb. 23, it had still granted none.
nonetheless, officials asked the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit to allow the military to take into account the unvaccinated status of the 35 members when making "deployment, assignment and other operational decisions." they argued that "forcing the navy to deploy plaintiffs while they are unvaccinated threatens the success of critical missions and needlessly endangers the health and safety of other service members.”
a three-judge panel on the court rejected the request, noting the discrepancy between how the branch has handled medical and religious exemption requests.
"the navy has granted hundreds of medical exemptions from vaccination requirements, allowing those service members to seek medical waivers and become deployable. but it has not accommodated any religious objection to any vaccine in seven years, preventing those seeking such accommodations from even being considered for medical waivers," the panel said.
judges said there is apparently no template for approving requests, but there is a disapproval template form. and during the process, navy officials sent memorandums to vice admiral john nowell asking that he disapprove the exemption requests, even those based on "sincerely held religious beliefs."
the navy has "has effectively stacked the deck against even those exemptions supported by plaintiffs’ immediate commanding officers and military chaplains," emphasizing the futility of pursuing exemptions, the panel said. further, letting 35 unvaccinated members deploy wouldn't seriously impede military function because over 5,000 other members are still on duty despite being unvaccinated, they added.
"defendants have not demonstrated 'paramount interests' that justify vaccinating these 35 plaintiffs against covid-19 in violation of their religious beliefs," the ruling stated.
the panel consisted of judges edith jones, a reagan nominee; stuart duncan, a trump nominee; and kurt engelhardt, a trump nominee.
mike berry, director of military affairs for first liberty institute, which is representing the plaintiffs, said the group was grateful for the ruling.
“the purge of religious servicemembers is not just devastating to morale, but it harms america’s national security. it’s time for our military to honor its constitutional obligations and grant religious accommodations for service members with sincere religious objections to the vaccine," berry said in a statement.
the navy declined to comment.
u.s. district judge reed o'connor, the george w. bush nominee who entered the injunction, has yet to rule on a motion to widen the preliminary injunction to all navy members seeking a religious exemption. he received arguments from both parties in february.

http://bitly.ws/sVDm
facing the disintegration of his climate agenda as ferocious heatwaves hit large parts of the world, joe biden has unveiled a new plan to push billions of dollars to us cities and states to help them cope better with extreme heat.
the president stopped short, however, of declaring a climate emergency.
biden outlined the new actions in a speech on wednesday at a former coal plant in massachusetts, which is now part of an offshore windfarm project.
“as president, i have a responsibility to act with urgency and resolve when our nation faces clear and present danger,” biden said. “and that’s what climate change is about. it is literally, not figuratively, a clear and present danger. the health of our citizens and our communities is literally at stake.”
02:45 joe biden unveils $2.3bn plan to tackle extreme heat – video
the initiatives are aimed at helping salvage the president’s tattered climate agenda, which has endured a torrid month.
last week, joe manchin, a west virginia democratic senator who owns a coal company, appeared to rule out supporting a new clean energy bill, seemingly dooming it in the evenly split senate.
the blow arrived just two weeks after the conservative-dominated supreme court restricted the ability of the federal government to curb emissions from power plants.
biden, speaking from a lectern set up on a rock pile to an audience that included democratic legislators, said: “climate change is literally an existential threat to our nation and to the world. so my message today is this: since congress is not acting as it should - and these guys here are, but we’re not getting many republican votes - this is an emergency. an emergency. and i will look at it that way.”
biden’s actions include $2.3bn in funding to help communities prepare for heatwaves, droughts and floods, new guidance that allows the federal government to help provide cooling centers and air conditioning, and new planned offshore wind energy leases for the gulf of mexico coast.
“right now, there are millions of people suffering from extreme heat at home so my team is also working with the states to deploy $385m right now. for the first time, states will be able to use federal funds to pay for air conditioners in homes, set up community cooling centres in schools where people can get through these extreme heat crises.”
the stakes of inaction on the climate crisis have been made starkly apparent this week, with more than 100 million americans in grip of a dangerous heatwave that has pushed temperatures as high as 115f (46c) in parts of the country.
elsewhere, disastrous wildfires have strafed france, spain and portugal, and the uk has endured its first ever recorded day of 40c heat.
the white house said the heatwaves showed the climate crisis is a “clear and present danger” to the us.
climate campaigners hoped biden would declare a climate state of emergency. karine jean-pierre, the white house press secretary, said that wouldn’t happen on wednesday but added that the option is “still on the table”.
the lack of such a declaration, or any sweeping ban of oil and gas drilling on public lands, is unlikely to satisfy those who have called for more vigorous action.
“biden must declare a climate emergency, ban crude oil exports and halt new fossil fuel infrastructure, including pipelines and export terminals,” said wenonah hauter, executive director of food & water watch.
“the clock is rapidly ticking towards inevitable, irreversible climate catastrophe. there is no more time to lose.”
some democrats have urged the president to declare a national emergency, which would allow him to block crude oil imports or direct the military to work on renewable energy production.
“for too long we have been waiting for a single piece of legislation, and a single senate vote, to take bold action on our climate crisis,” a group of senators including the leading progressives bernie sanders and elizabeth warren, wrote to biden this week.
“as a result, we urge you to put us on an emergency footing and aggressively use your executive powers to address the climate crisis.”
but it is unclear whether such an extraordinary use of presidential powers, normally used in a military context, would survive if challenged in the rightwing-dominated supreme court, or if it would be enough to make a significant dent in planet-heating emissions.
“declaring a climate emergency doesn’t lower any emissions,” conceded sheldon whitehouse, a democratic senator from rhode island. “you have to move on to acting like it’s a climate emergency, and i’m looking forward to those steps.”
biden may take further action this week by directing new regulations to cut pollution from cars, trucks and power plants.
but the window of opportunity to avoid disastrous climate change is rapidly closing.
scientists have said the world must slash emissions in half this decade, and phase them out entirely by 2050, if catastrophically worse heatwaves, floods, drought and other climate impacts are to be averted. the us will fall about halfway short of such a goal absent any significant congressional action, even with presidential orders, analysts have forecast.
“president biden cannot do it alone,” said heather zichal, chief executive of the american clean power association. “we urge congress to get back to the table and come to a consensus on clean energy provisions that our country so desperately needs.”
biden’s remarks on wednesday were attended by political allies including john kerry, the special presidential envoy for climate; massachusetts senators warren and ed markey; whitehouse of rhode island and massachusetts congressmen jake auchincloss and bill keating.
the president promised executive actions in the coming weeks. “when it comes to fighting climate change, i will not take no for an answer. i will do everything in my power to clean our air and water, protect our people’s health, to win the clean energy future.”
in an unexpected digression, he also recalled growing up in claymont, delaware, near polluting oil refineries. “you had to put on your windshield wipers to get literally the oil slick off the window. that’s why i and so damn many other people i grew up have cancer.”
the white house released a health summary from biden’s doctor last november that said: “he has had several localized, non-melanoma skin cancers removed with mohs surgery before he started his presidency.”
climate activists applauded biden’s pledge to do more to tackle global heating but some lamented the lack of an emergency declaration.
“president biden’s announcements, while welcome, don’t even scratch the surface of what’s needed and what communities suffering most are demanding,” said collin rees, us program manager at oil change international. “biden’s climate legacy hangs in the balance – we’re in desperate need of bold leadership, not tinkering around the edges while the world burns.”
varshini prakash, executive director of the youth-led sunrise movement, added: “young people are tired of receiving scraps from our government. president biden must immediately declare a climate emergency, and do everything in his executive power to confront the climate crisis.”

https://www.theepochtimes.com/canadian-military-expected-to-suspend-vaccine-mandate-this-summer-report_4616017.html?utm_source=ref_share&utm_campaign=tw&rs=SHRFJKGHK
the canadian armed forces (caf) is looking to follow the federal public service and suspend their vaccine mandate, the ottawa sun reported thursday.
the newspaper obtained a leaked copy of a new draft covid-19 directive from the chief of defence staff (cds) wayne eyre.
it states that members of the caf will no longer need to attest of their vaccination status, nor will new recruits be required to be fully vaccinated.
but like for public servants and the federally regulated sectors, it appears the policy is only suspended and not completely abolished.
unvaccinated public servants were allowed back to work on june 20, but ottawa said the vaccine mandate could be brought back if it deems it necessary.
“suspending the requirement for caf members to be fully vaccinated against covid-19 will require significant administrative effort to address the files of members who were not compliant with the cds directives on caf covid-19 vaccination,” the draft reportedly says.
an unidentified spokesperson from the department of national defence (dnd) told the epoch times it would not comment on “leaked documents or speculative plans.”
“the current, existing directive will continue to apply until otherwise stated.”
the leaked draft suggests that unvaccinated caf members won’t be completely scot-free. it reportedly says that those who went through administrative reviews and have future release dates will still be discharged.
other disciplinary procedures will be stopped, but they will leave a mark on the members’ files.
the new policy also says that members who were dishonourably discharged under the 5(f) mention, “unsuitable for further service,” will be allowed to re-enrol, but only with approval from the cds.
reactions
“this is a good step in the right direction for the caf and the federal government’s disgraceful treatment of our active duty military members,” says andrew macgillivray, spokesperson for veterans for freedom (v4f), a civil liberties advocacy group composed of former caf members.
“i'm unsure if they will ever rid the stain of this which will no doubt, amongst other things, have a negative impact on recruiting.”
macgillivray wonders if discharged members who have cashed out their pensions, taking sometimes huge losses, will be able to buy back in.
and “how about a written apology from the cds or the mnd [minister of national defence]?” he asks.
the epoch times previously reported on the stories of several caf members who were ousted for refusing covid-19 vaccination and reached out to them for reactions.
“i think it’s a win for current serving members and veterans released under 5(f). it’s an opportunity for caf members to continue their career if they choose to do so,” says nicholas collins, who served four years as a vehicle technician before being released under 5(f).
but collins says it doesn’t entirely “fix the problem that the government created.”
“there will be lots of veterans that were released for not getting the covid shot that will choose not to re-enlist, including myself. the trust is broken and it can’t be repaired.”
former logistics officer natasha lis, who served 18 years and was released voluntarily to avoid a dishonourable discharge, believes the rapid suspension of the mandate less than a year after its implementation is a sign it was political rather than based on an operation requirement.
she also cautions about the suspension, which doesn’t mean a full repeal.
“any unvaccinated members who are able to re-enrol will have to worry about reimplementation of the mandate, continuation of the remedial measure and administrative review processes, and retaliation and discrimination from their chain of command and peers,” she says.
“why would anyone want to rejoin and be subject to that? an apology is due and all of the unethical policy actions taken need to be walked back.”
sandra carmichael, who served for 25 years and worked in the communications branch, echoed lis’s comments.
she says she wouldn’t consider joining back unless the mandate is fully repealed and there’s an acknowledgement that such policies should not be implemented.
carmichael said the caf needs to “recognize that they can’t do that.”
“for me that’s clear, it’s not respecting my rights and i don’t have to subject my body to anything that the government or the caf, or anybody, tells me.”

u.s. army begins to discharge soldiers who refuse covid-19 vaccination

u.s. army soldiers who refuse to be vaccinated for covid-19 will soon be discharged, the military branch announced wednesday.
the army said it will "immediately begin separating soldiers from the service" who refuse to be vaccinated or who don't have an approved or pending request for exemption.
"army readiness depends on soldiers who are prepared to train, deploy, fight and win our nation's wars," said secretary of the army christine wormuth. "unvaccinated soldiers present risk to the force and jeopardize readiness."
soldiers who are discharged for refusing to be vaccinated "will not be eligible for involuntary separation pay" and may have to return any unearned special or incentive pay, the army said.
as of jan. 26, it said, 96% of active troops have been completely vaccinated, while 3,350 soldiers have refused to get the vaccine. nearly 5,900 have received temporary exemptions.
those who have asked for a medical exemption or religious accommodations are temporarily exempt from the vaccination requirement while their requests are being reviewed.
"to date, army commanders have relieved a total of six regular army leaders, including two battalion commanders, and issued 3,073 general officer written reprimands to soldiers for refusing the vaccination order," the army said late last month.
the pentagon began requiring members of the military to get vaccinated last summer.

over 500 service members filed a suit against the government on monday. these individuals argue that the vaccine mandate forced on the military was not approved and therefore should never have been administered to the military.
around 520 military service members filed a suit on monday against the government. their primary argument is that the vaccine mandate is illegal because there is no approved vaccine available in the us. this means that approximately 55% ( amount vaccinated since the august 23, 2021 mandate from the secretary of defense (secdef) ) of the military have been vaccinated illegally and under duress.

https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/canadian-service-members-go-court-stop-military-covid-vaccine-mandate
as u.s. service members ramp up their legal challenges to military covid-19 vaccine mandates, their canadian counterparts are joining the action.
the justice centre for constitutional freedoms (jccf) said tuesday it had filed "the first of many [planned] injunctions" against the dismissal of canadian armed forces (caf) members for refusing the shots "on the basis of health concerns, religious or conscientious objections."
the canadian civil liberties group has received "hundreds of requests" for help since january from active-duty members who are facing removal under the item 5(f) process, it said in a press release.
caf considers them "unsuitable for further service" because they developed "personal weakness or behaviour" due to factors "wholly or chiefly ... within [their] control" by refusing covid vaccines.
canada's department of national defence confirmed to canadian news organization true north in november that members of the armed forces risk removal as "unsuitable" unless they get an approved accommodation. caf's vaccination rate was 98.3% in january when it launched formal proceedings against more than 900 members for noncompliance, the canadian press reported.
legal challenges are much further along below the border. navy seals with religious objections, represented by first liberty institute, won a reprieve in january from a federal judge, who then expanded their action into a class-action suit covering the entire service in march. the navy said may 25 it has granted 28 religious accommodations.
air force service members also represented by the christian legal defense nonprofit recently requested a "class wide temporary restraining order" after their religious exemptions were denied. only 68 exemptions have been approved.
jccf's first client to go to court is shannon jones, "a healthy and skilled" caf member who stands to lose her pension unless her injunction is approved at next week's hearing. director of communications marnie cathcart told just the news it wasn't sharing its filings "at this time."
"this is fundamentally a patched together policy designed to punish those who do not get in line with the political objectives assigned to [department of national defence] policy from ottawa," said the lawyer commissioned for the project, phillip millar.
the vaccine mandate has "nothing to do with operational effectiveness as it is simply a political move imposed on the military by the federal government," he said in jccf's release.
a former combat officer and assistant crown attorney who says he has won compensation cases for sexual assault victims and cleared the "wrongfully accused," millar recently applied to join the "hardcore litigation department" billionaire elon musk is building at tesla. he calls himself a "samurai for hire" on twitter.
millar told just the news these were his first covid vaccine cases for service members. he has previously represented university professors put on unpaid leave on the same grounds.
he expects one or two injunction hearings per month and is planning to add cases on behalf of unvaccinated youth who are prevented from training in the "army cadet" program.
millar believes caf chose the "unsuitable" administrative removal process because a vaccine-specific rule lets members challenge their removal in court. if he can secure injunctions for clients, they can remain in the service while finishing the multiyear grievance process, millar said.
jccf kicked off the legal effort a month ago with 16 caf members, including 28-year reservist james topp, who faces court martial for "conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline."
he posted a tik tok video in which a uniformed topp says he's on unpaid leave "because i will not change my vaccination status," the cbc reported. the video did not violate a military policy on "people in uniform making political statements" because topp was "speaking about a policy that directly affects him and his conviction," millar said.
topp is walking across canada to protest covid mandates and support those punished for noncompliance or coerced into compliance, chronicling his journey on tik tok for the past few months. he reached the lake superior town of marathon on monday.
he started his journey from vancouver on feb. 20, the same day police cracked down on freedom convoy protesters in ottawa under prime minister justin trudeau's unprecedented invocation of the emergencies act.
"i have to watch what i say from here on out for a little while because the eye of sauron is upon me," topp said as he left, likening caf to the primary antagonist in "the lord of the rings."
one of the jailed freedom convoy leaders has been banned from speaking her mind, at least on social media, as a condition of keeping her freedom.
the government argued last month that tamara lich should be sent back to jail for violating her march bail conditions, which included a ban on supporting anything "related" to the freedom convoy, including on social media, and travel to ontario.
a supporter sent her a pendant emblazoned with a truck image and the words "freedom" and "canada" and asked for a photo of her wearing it, which lich gave permission to post, the cbc reported.
she also accepted jccf's george jonas freedom award for "spending 18 days unjustly jailed" for leading a "peaceful protest" against covid mandates. the award ceremony is june 16 in toronto, but lich testified she wouldn't attend without court permission.
justice kevin phillips agreed these actions didn't violate her bail conditions and amended them to let her travel to ontario but not downtown ottawa, which had been paralyzed by the convoy. even though he said canadian courts "are not the thought police," phillips refused to lift the social media ban because that would facilitate "toxic groupthink," jccf said after the hearing.

this is based on inaccurate data, which has now been withdrawn.
a tiktok clip posted to instagram falsely claims that official data shows the number of deaths among us military personnel rose by 1,100% in the first 10 months in 2021.
while the people in the clip, which features us right-wing pastor rick wiles and appears to be taken from his website trunews, do not directly refer to covid-19 vaccines, text embedded in the video states: “admitted - hiv protein added to shot”.

us military deaths didn’t rise by 1,100%
the claim of a huge spike in deaths among us military personnel in 2021 emerged in january 2022, when data published via the defense medical epidemiology database (dmed) was cited by an ohio lawyer representing three “whistleblowers” at a panel discussion on covid-19 vaccines.
the dmed is a publicly-accessible resource containing both current and historical data on diseases and medical events experienced by members of the us military.
after it emerged that the data for 2021 showed an alarming increase in deaths and incidences of medical conditions such as cancer, peter graves, spokesperson for the defense health agency’s armed forces surveillance division, told us fact checkers politifact that the division had reviewed data in the dmed "and found that the data was incorrect for the years 2016-2020”.
he added that the database system had been taken offline to “identify and correct the root-cause of the data corruption”.
the error in the data was the result of the correct 2021 figures on the incidence of health conditions being compared to an inaccurate five-year average for 2016-2020, which “represented only a small fraction of actual medical diagnoses” and so gave the false impression of a significant increase in 2021.
this inaccuracy has been highlighted by at least one outlet which originally reported on the apparent spike in illnesses and deaths in 2021.
we have written about this data being used to make inaccurate claims about vaccine risks twice before.
hiv protein has not been added to covid-19 vaccine
while not directly addressed by the speakers in the video, the embedded text on the tiktok clip states: “admitted - hiv protein added to shot [vaccine]”.
there is no hiv protein in the vaccines currently in use.
this falsehood may be linked to the fact that a prospective covid-19 vaccine developed in australia had used a small piece of protein from the hiv virus in order to induce a stronger immune response.this vaccine candidate was abandoned after an early trial stage in which some participants returned false hiv positive results.

three united states military doctors have blown the whistle on documents allegedly from the united states department of defense (dod) that they had access to, which show "skyrocketing rates of disease" since the introduction and mandating of the ccp virus vaccines in armed forces, human rights attorney leigh dundas told the epoch times.
dundas was recently approached by dr. samuel sigoloff, special forces flight surgeon lt. col. peter chambers, and aerospace occupational medicine specialist lt. col. theresa long.
they handed documents to dundas, who appeared recently with attorney tom renz in a five-hour hearing organized by sen. ron johnson (r-wis.) titled "covid-19: second opinion."
renz shared some of the numbers related to medical disorders in the u.s. military data with the epoch times.
the whistleblowers, who are represented by renz, gave him the data "under penalty of perjury," he said during the hearing.
renz intends to submit the information to the courts, he told johnson.
the dod responded that the dmed (defense medical epidemiology database) data from 2016 to 2020 that the whistleblowers brought up was erroneous and incomplete, and is currently under review.
"dha’s armed forces surveillance division (afsd) conducted a complete review of the data contained in the defense medical epidemiology database (dmed) and found that the data was incorrect for the years 2016-2020," maj. charlie dietz, a spokesperson for the dod, told the epoch times.
"dmed is a web-based tool to query de-identified active component personnel and medical event data contained within the defense medical surveillance system (dmss).
"comparing the dmed database to the source data contained in dmss, afhsd discovered that the total number of medical diagnoses from 2016-2020 that were accessible in dmed represented only a small fraction of actual medical diagnoses for those years. in contrast, the 2021 total number of medical diagnoses were up to date in dmed. comparison of 2021 to 2016-2020 resulted in the appearance of significant increased occurrence of all medical diagnoses in 2021 because of the under-reported data for 2016-2020. afhsd has taken dmed offline to identify and correct the root-cause of the data corruption," dietz said.
renz responded: "the dod has claimed that the dmed data from the years 2016-2020 was incorrect. this is absurd. we spend millions of dollars per year on dmed and people monitoring dmed which is one of the premier epidemiological databases in the world. accuracy in this database is critical as it is used to monitor for health issues in our troops.
"the dod would have us believe that the dmed database was wrong from 2016-2020 but then magically was corrected in 2021 despite the fact that they had not noticed it was wrong until we pointed it out in our testimony before senator johnson. further, we are asked to believe that in 2020, the year of what they claim to be the greatest pandemic since 1918, and despite the fact that it is documented that the cdc was also watching this database, no one noticed an error of 20 million-plus injury/disease codes per year," renz told the epoch times.
“the department of defense, the biden administration is on notice they must preserve these records and this must be investigated,” johnson said in the five-hour hearing in washington.
"renz also informed me that some dmed data showing registered diagnoses of myocarditis had been removed from the database. following the allegation that dmed data had been doctored, i immediately wrote to you on january 24 requesting that you preserve all records referring, relating, or reported to dmed. i have yet to hear whether you have complied with this request." johnson wrote in a letter (pdf) to lloyd austin, the u.s. defense secretary.
medical data
dundas told the epoch times that "in january of 2021. they introduced the vaccine, they mandated the vaccine for the u.s. military members. and in just the first 10 months of that vaccination year, anxiety jumped from 37,000 typically prior to that to 931,791 cases. it was a 2,400 plus percent increase."
she went on to say that breast cancer was "pretty formulaic," ranging from 500 to 900 cases for the five years prior to the introduction of the mandatory vaccination.
"first 10 months or 2021. they were at 4,068 cases. again, it was about 450 some odd percent increase.
"female infertility 2,200 cases a year a bad year would be 2,300 cases a year, first 10 months of 2021 after the vaccine 10,713 cases. "
even diseases that have not been connected so far with the vaccines saw a dramatic spike.
"esophageal cancer in the u.s. military. very, very minimal. twenty-five, 26 cases, maybe a bad year is 39 cases. jumps to 200 plus cases," dundas said.
"january acute myocarditis was in 176 cases, but now it's practically down to 70 ... bad that stuff going on," she continued.
"bell's palsy 400 cases a year on average in the first 10 months of 2021 over 1,300 cases. cognitive issues way up altered mental status way up. congenital male malformations doubled.
"hiv 400 cases on average [per year] and now over 2,400 cases in the first 10 months."
miscarriages
according to the whistleblower documents, miscarriages in the military were at 1,400 to 1,500 a year in the first three quarters of 2020, and it increased to over 4,000 during the first 10 months of 2021.
the epoch times reached out to dr. christiane northrup, a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist with more than 30 years of experience and the former president of the american holistic medical association.
particularly alarming is the increase in miscarriages, she said.
"here's what we were finding—starting in april of 2021. all of us in the five doc's group, dr. lee merritt, dr. carrie madej, dr. sherri tenpenny, and dr. larry palevsky, and me. we were hearing stories from all over the country about women who were having abnormal bleeding, miscarriages, and stillbirths, just from being around the people who had recently had the shot," northrup told the epoch times.
"we all got together and we said, wait a minute. we've got to study this," northrup went on.
"people that i knew in the fertility business, we're finding that all these women were having problems. i was getting a lot of personal calls. 'what do i do?' ... we were very concerned."
michael yeadon, the former pfizer vice president and chief scientist for allergy and respiratory research, and dr. wolfgang wodarg issued a petition (pdf) for administrative action regarding confirmation of efficacy on several of their findings regarding the ccp (chinese communist party) virus vaccines.
"we detailed a series of mechanistic toxicology concerns which we believed were reasonable to hold, unless & until proven not to occur," yeadon told the epoch times.
"among those was that adverse impacts on conception & ability to sustain a pregnancy were foreseeable," he added.
"it’s important to note that none of these gene-based agents had completed what’s called 'reproductive toxicology.' over a year later, this battery of tests in animals still has not been done. so there was & still is no data package supporting safety in pregnancy or prior to conception."
one of the whistleblowers, dr. pete constantine chambers, has been practicing medicine for 25 years, 16 of which he served as a flight surgeon attached to special operations.
"here is a question that troubles me," chambers told the epoch times via email.
"after having my orders cut short leaving me no medical insurance coverage, losing my pay and leave that i had accumulated without any forewarning for exhibiting the army value of personal courage, and practicing the safe standard of care medicine by an entity i have served for so long; 1) what will happen to my enlisted troops? 2) how many? how many soldiers and airmen will experience adverse reactions, some of which result in disabilities or god forbid, death.
"one might call a provider such as myself an 'anti-vaxxer.' nothing is further from the truth," he further noted.
"i took the full course starting in january. i trusted my government and medical leaders. i have taken every vaccine the army has given me since my first day as a private, in 1983. however, i too have experienced adverse reactions and am currently in the care of medical specialists exploring the signs and symptoms post second vaccine as well as the ominous finding on my brain mri.
"i love my country, my state, and the heroes i work with and for. i believe all americans are worth the sacrifices we make to keep us safe. i also believe as a provider in the first stanza of the hippocratic oath; 'first of all, do no harm.'"

spread the word
this is great. governments cannot do anything about the virus.
they have no power to do so, either physically/medically, or legally. none of their mandates do anything of any value whatsoever to reduce either deaths from the virus or transmission of it and that is also true of the “vaccines,” which are not vaccines.
florida alone proves that in the united states. it has no mandates that are enforceable anywhere for anything — masks, vaccines, etc. and it has the lowest covid-case rate in the entire united states, far lower than new york or california which have the harshest mandates of all kinds. far lower than vermont or any other state where virtually 100% of the population is vaccinated with the non-vaccines.
in fact, the more people are vaccinated — in vermont, new hampshire, maine — all those democrat-run states filled with people complying with the mandates, the higher the number of cases goes up there. most, over 50%, of the deaths in those states (over 70% in the uk ) from the virus are people who have been fully-“vaccinated.” but not in florida, where case numbers and deaths are dropping by double-digits every week, every month.
and those same results are happening everywhere else in the world where the results are reported — iceland, israel, the uk – which is why our government is hiding the statistics that it knows about the effects of the “vaccines” in america, and the only statistics that are available for entire nations is coming from those other countries – everywhere but the us.
the only thing the worthless, unelected federal bureaucracies are good for is spitting out statistics from the data they force everyone to provide them. and instead of doing that, they spit out mandates that are completely baseless in science and law.
and you won’t hear a word about any of that now from the new york times, cnn, etc., facebook, twitter, the platforms that echo whatever they receive from the new york times, all of whom have been lying all along and pretending that florida has been a virtual death camp run by the “evil” governor desantis who refuses to impose any of those mandates on his state. they have been lying along with the federal government about every aspect of this virus and the “vaccines” all along.
and the one thing they will never do is admit that they have been wrong and lying all along about everything and that governor desantis has been right. like marxists throughout the world, their own actions bring about disaster, and they always blame someone else.
and it is child abuse and medical malpractice to even think about giving these “vaccines” to any child who does not have multiple comorbidities — unless his parents want it, of course. it is beyond monstrous to force children to have it forced on them by government mandate, subjecting them and their immune systems to experimental chemicals whose relatively short-term, let alone long-term, the adverse potential is completely unknown, literally turning entire populations of children into guinea pigs for no medical reason whatsoever, since their chance of dying from the virus is literally one in 2 million. yes, that is the actual statistic.
a total of 92 children, out of 48 million, have died with, not from, but with the virus this entire time in the us. and if you tell that to any true-believer democrat he/she literally won’t believe you. all they have heard from joe biden and the teachers unions and the federal government bureaucrats and the fake news “media” is the terrible peril their children are in, or the terrible risk their teachers are in if they are exposed to the children, none of which is true at all.
and it is right in the cdc’s own statistics, although you have to dig deep in them to find it since they do nothing to make it clear.
the total number of children who have died with, not from, the virus since march 2020, is fewer children than have been shot by guns in chicago alone in 2021, fewer than the number of children struck by lightning, or dying in automobile accidents.
and yet look at the panic they, the marxist blob, joe biden and the unelected federal government bureaucrats, and their social media and fake news propaganda organs in unison all have been and are, deliberately inciting in children and their parents about their children’s supposedly, according to them, highly-likely death from the virus — deaths which statistics prove are, in fact, a virtual impossibility, not even a remote possibility under any circumstance.
not a single child without multiple comorbidities has died from the virus in the us or anywhere else.
and yet they, the marxist blob have been intent on terrifying those children and their parents into obeying all their idiotic mandates, like wearing masks, and now getting the quasi-“vaccines,” which are obviously less effective against the virus than flu shots are against the flu, with promises of salvation from the virus and all the hysteria they themselves have engendered, salvation which never happens, because nothing they demand ever actually works, resulting in the marxist blob needing to blame someone else — again, as it always does about the terrible, real-life consequences of all its actions and its mandates, its use of force against the citizens for no purpose other than to display and rejoice in its own, completely-illegitimate power over them.
that is why even europeans are refusing to permit “vaccines” for children. and yet biden and fauci can’t wait to stick it to all the kids in america and destroy people’s lives if they refuse to comply with their fascist demands, demands which have no basis whatsoever in medicine nor in the constitution.
all that mandates of any kind, mandates forbidden (because it does not specifically permit such) by the constitution to be issued by the executive branch of the federal government, do is take away peoples’ freedom and destroy the countries that are subjected to them, spreading fear and panic among the population.
the federal government is literally powerless against the virus, powerless in every sense. and it is despicable that it, the government which has become just another cog in the marxist blob, refuses to accept, let alone admit, that very fact.
the pathological-liar sociopath career-bureaucrat fauci needs to be fired, his entire bureaucracy-department needs to be eliminated, all the money for research it controls needs to be returned to the treasury, and he and anyone who has been acting in concert with him need to be prosecuted, because he has known all, or most, of this all along, and he personally participated in the creation of the virus, against the orders of both presidents obama and trump, by giving us taxpayers’ money to the chinese military’s bio-weapons lab in wuhan doing research to create viruses like this, performing “gain-of-function” research, as it is euphemistically called, and he has been using all of his mandates he’s been coming up with as gaslighting to divert attention from that very fact, the arsonist rushing to the fire he created to “save” everyone.
and the sock-puppet marxist joe biden can’t find enough mandates to impose on americans to destroy the economy, which he is actively attempting to do in every single action he takes, and turn americans against each other, and fill the nation with terror unnecessarily and with no scientific basis, about a virus which is relatively harmless to the general public, anyone who does not have multiple comorbidities. the cdc’s own data proves that.

https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/10/navy-has-discharged-nearly-2000-sailors-for-refusing-covid-vaccine/
the number of u.s. navy sailors released from service for refusing covid vaccination is nearing 2,000.
a total of 1,893 sailors have been “separated” for refusing the covid vaccine, according to the navy’s latest report. that’s 180 more than were reported last month, according to usni news.
more than 81 percent of those released so far have been active-duty sailors and 17 percent have been reservists, all of whom were honorably discharged.
this news comes as lawmakers demand to know when the military-wide mandate will end, and the navy faces a class action lawsuit over the mandate from within its own ranks, with plaintiffs including more than two dozen seals.
an injunction in the class action case keeps the navy’s vaccine refusers from being punished as long as they file for a religious exemption. requests for those have been made by 3,318 active-duty sailors and 859 reservists.
oral testimony in the case is scheduled to begin the week of feb. 6, 2023 in the fifth circuit court of appeals, usni news reported.
the navy has granted 28 permanent medical exemptions to active-duty sailors and reservists, as well as 221 temporary medical exemptions.
almost 2,500 active-duty sailors remain to be vaccinated, while more than 390,000 navy service members have been fully vaccinated since that was made mandatory throughout the military in late 2021, according to a dod dashboard.
the marine corps has let go of even more vaccine refusers than the navy. that branch has discharged 3,511 marines to date, according to its october report.
in the army, 1,777 active-duty soldiers have been separated amid a 97 percent rate of full vaccination, according to the branch’s october report.
the air force hasn’t reported a separation total since its july report, when 834 service members had been discharged.
the department of defense has administered more than 8.7 million doses of covid vaccines, according to the dashboard.

https://ksltv.com/493559/3-air-force-cadets-who-refused-vaccine-wont-be-commissioned/
washington (ap) — three cadets at the u.s. air force academy who have refused the covid-19 vaccine will not be commissioned as military officers but will graduate with bachelor’s degrees, the academy said saturday.
academy spokesman dean miller said that a fourth cadet who had refused the vaccine until about a week ago, decided to be vaccinated and will graduate and become an air force officer.
in a statement, miller said that while the three will get a degree “they will not be commissioned into the united states air force as long as they remain unvaccinated.” he added that a decision on whether to require the three to reimburse the united states for education costs in lieu of service will be made by the secretary of the air force.
as of saturday, the air force is the only military academy, so far, where cadets are not being commissioned due to vaccine refusal. all of the more than 1,000 army cadets at the u.s. military academy at west point, new york, graduated and were commissioned as officers earlier in the day and all were vaccinated.
the naval academy in annapolis, maryland, said saturday that none of the navy or marine corps seniors there are being prevented from commissioning due to vaccine refusals. that graduation is later this week, and the air force ceremony is wednesday in colorado. ahead of that ceremony, the u.s. air force academy board conducted its standard review of whether this year’s class had met all graduation requirements on friday.
defense secretary lloyd austin, who is the scheduled speaker at the air force graduation, last year made the covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members, including those at the military academies, saying the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force.
military leaders have argued that troops for decades have been required to get as many as 17 vaccines in order to maintain the health of the force, particularly those deploying overseas. students arriving at the military academies get a regimen of shots on their first day — such as measles, mumps and rubella – if they aren’t already vaccinated. and they routinely get flu shots in the fall.
members of congress, the military, and the public have questioned if the exemption reviews by the military services have been fair. there have been multiple lawsuits filed against the mandate, mainly centering on the fact that very few service members have been granted religious exemptions from the shots.
until the covid-19 vaccine, very few military members sought religious exemptions to any vaccines.
lt. col. brian maguire, an air force academy spokesman, said a week ago that all four of the cadets had been informed of the potential consequences and met with the academy’s superintendent. and he noted then that they still had time before graduation to change their minds – and one did.
the military academies for years have required students under certain circumstances to repay tuition costs if they leave during their junior or senior year. often those cases involve students with disciplinary issues or similar problems. the costs can be as much as $200,000, or more, and any final decision on repayment is made by the service secretary.
across the military, the army, navy, air force and marine corps have discharged as many as 4,000 active duty service members for refusing the vaccine. those who flatly refuse the vaccine without seeking an exemption are still being discharged. but the courts have stalled additional discharges of service members who sought religious exemptions.
according to the military, as many as 20,000 service members have asked for religious exemptions. thousands have been denied.
about 99% of the active duty navy and 98% of the air force, marine corps and army have gotten at least one shot.

us air force academy cadets denied commission over vaccine refusal the guardian
for refusing to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, three us air force academy cadets wont be commissioned as military officers, though they will receive college degrees, a spokesperson for the school said saturday.
academy spokesperson dean miller said in a statement that the three cadets in question wont be commissioned as air force officers as long as they remain unvaccinated, though they would get their bachelors of science degrees. the military branch had not decided yet whether to require the trio to reimburse the us for education costs in lieu of service, miller said.
a fourth cadet who had initially turned down the shot providing protection against covid-19 ultimately got vaccinated and would graduate with an officers commission, miller added.
the air force academy didnt identify any of the cadets who were denied officers commissions.

https://worldnewsguru.us/politics/press-conference-tomorrow-risking-careers-active-duty-military-officers-will-call-for-an-end-to-unlawful-dod-vaccine-mandates/449299/
on tuesday, october 18, active duty officers in the us military will speak at a press conference calling for an end to the dod’s unlawful covid-19 mandates and expose the harsh and unjust treatment that 80,000+ unvaccinated service members continue to face.
these service members will join their attorney, dale saran esq., who will provide updates to the cases he is litigating in federal court against the military covid-19 vaccine mandate.
the gateway pundit’s jim hoft has interviewed several members of the military to discuss the unjust treatment that they and their fellow military members have been subjected to under the unlawful mandate.
the mandate has forced thousands out of military service and discouraged new recruits from joining. military recruiting and retention is suffering.
trending: breaking: doj recommending steve bannon be sentenced to six months in prison
lt. john bowes submitted a request for a religious accommodation last year to the us military to excuse him from taking the experimental covid vaccine, a request that was later denied. lt. bowes has been grounded since the denial last september.
fighter pilot capt. tom stewart, usmc, described his personal story of challenging the us military vaccine mandates. this included the unlawful process they used to ground us pilots back in september, wasting nine months of manpower and resources.
in may of 2022, over 500 members of the military filed a lawsuit against the government arguing that the vaccine mandate is illegal because there is no approved vaccine available in the us.
from the press release:
advisory risking careers, active-duty military officers to call for an end to unlawful dod vaccine mandates attorney dale saran to provide legal updates; officers will give firsthand accounts of dod’s coercive tactics that punish soldiers, threaten constitution and military readiness less than 20 years have passed since the failed anthrax vaccine immunization program (avip), in which a judge ruled against compulsory vaccination using emergency-use authorized (eua) products. using the same tactics of coercion and punishment from the anthrax vaccine mandate, the department of defense is now unlawfully forcing service members to take experimental, eua covid-19 vaccines. military readiness, constitutional rights, and national security are all at risk due to the mandates. some of the officers recently discussed these issues on bret weinstein’s dark horse podcast, “support and defend: military whistleblowers confront a rogue chain of command.” saran and his clients seek redress and hope to bring public awareness to these unlawful mandates and the issues plaguing our military.
stay tuned for details about what is shared at the press conference.

burkina faso’s coup leader-turned-president defended his military takeover on friday, though he acknowledged it was “perhaps reprehensible” and inconsistent with the united nations’ values.
lt. col. paul henri sandaogo damiba said the overthrow of the democratically elected president in january was “necessary and indispensable.”
“it was, above all, an issue of survival for our nation,” he said. that’s even if it was “perhaps reprehensible in terms of the principles held dear by the united nations and the international community as a whole.”
burkina faso’s coup came in the wake of similar takeovers in mali and in guinea, heightening fears of a rollback of democracy in west africa. none of the juntas has committed to a date for new elections.
many in burkina faso, however, supported the military takeover, frustrated with the previous government’s inability to stem islamic extremist violence that has killed thousands and displaced at least 2 million.
yet the violence has failed to wane in the months since damiba took over. earlier this month, he also took over the position of defense minister after dismissing a brigadier general from the post.
the burkina faso leader said friday that his transitional government will remain in power for almost two more years despite calls from west african neighbors for a quicker return to democratic rule. but damiba gave no precise date for the holding of new elections in his speech to the u.n. general assembly.
he warned, however, that the islamic insurgency embroiling burkina faso has security risks for the rest of the world too emphasizing that europe “is the closest continent to africa.”
“no precautions or prevention measures will prevent terrorism from crossing the atlantic if the sahel is abandoned,” damiba said. “nothing at all will be able to stop the youth in the sahel countries and its surroundings from giving in to the temptation of perilous immigration to europe through the sahara and the mediterranean if these youth no longer have any hope by staying at home.”

members of the freedom caucus are urging republican leaders to postpone their vote on the massive annual defense authorization bill until next year unless the vaccine mandate is repealed.
the freedom caucus blasted the biden administration for continuing to coerce service members to comply with experimental covid vaccine mandates despite joe biden’s admission that the “pandemic is over.”
“on september 18, 2022, president biden admitted ‘the pandemic is over.’ yet, the president and his “woke” pentagon continue to force an experimental and largely ineffective vaccine onto america’s military personnel, and thousands of our best and bravest service members face involuntary discharges for refusing on religious or medical grounds – and the department of defense inspector general has raised serious concerns regarding the wholesale denial of vaccine mandate exemption requests,” the group wrote in a letter to house minority leader kevin mccarthy and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on tuesday.
“furthermore, even while president biden’s policies are pushing highly trained and experienced personnel out of the military, every service branch is struggling to meet its recruitment goals. this is irrational and unacceptable,” the letter states.
upon the gop winning majorities in the house or senate following the midterm elections, a new congress can revise the annual national defense authorization act, the group said.
“congressional republicans still have the opportunity to stand in defense of our nation’s military – if we stand united,” the letter states. “just as they did in july, democrats will need republican votes to pass the ndaa, and the house freedom caucus urges all republicans to hold the line to force democrats to reverse the policies of president biden undermining our nation’s military and its combat readiness, starting with the vaccine mandate.
new: the house freedom caucus to call on the gop to reject the ndaa unless dems reverse policies they say undermine the military.

*end "woke" ideology
*halt climate spending
*create special ig to investigate us involvement in ukraine pic.twitter.com/mgsy9mmg8m — kadia goba (@kadiagoba) october 11, 2022
the senate began its debate on the ndaa on tuesday. a final vote on the legislation is expected after the midterm elections.
“the measure would then be reconciled in conference with the house version of the ndaa, which passed in june in a 329-101 vote, with 39 democrats and 62 republicans voting against the legislation,” the hill reports.
in addition to repealing the vaccine mandate for service members, the freedom caucus is also demanding republicans “end the contamination of our military by radical leftists ‘woke’ ideologies” and investigate us involvement in ukraine.
“republicans must demand that the ndaa: (1) fully repeals the vaccine mandate and allows service members involuntarily discharged to be reinstated without penalty; (2) ends the contamination of our military by radical leftist ‘woke’ ideologies and the prioritization of politics over combat readiness; (3) halts wasteful spending on ‘green new deal’ pet climate projects; and (4) establishes a special inspector general on u.s. involvement in ukraine,” the letter states.
unless the demands are met and the ndaa is amended to protect service members and check the biden administration’s political exploitation of the military, republicans should delay passage until the next congress is in session, when the freedom caucus anticipates having “a new republican majority to comprehensively rework the ndaa to serve america’s service members instead of leftist political agendas.”
hundreds of service members across all military branches have been discharged over their refusal to comply with covid vaccine mandates.
most of the members that applied for religious exemptions were denied and then punished or discharged.
“about 16,000 service members have applied for an exemption to biden’s vaccine mandate over the past year. fewer than 20 exemptions have been approved — the marine corps has granted six conscientious objections; the air force, nine, and the navy has granted one exemption for a reserve sailor on the condition he must be fully vaccinated if he is called up to active-duty service,” the new york post reports. “everyone else who applied was either denied, and then punished or discharged, or left in limbo while the application makes its way through the administrative ranks.”
it’s unclear how many service members are suffering from covid vaccine injury.
while thousands of america’s finest were banned from serving their country for refusing to comply, with democrats using the military as a “social justice” experiment, recruitment is the lowest its been in years.
the army fell about 15,000 soldiers, or 25 percent, short of its recruitment goal in 2022, the associated press reported last week.
“according to officials, the marine corps, which usually goes into each fiscal year with as much as 50% of its recruiting goal already locked in, has only a bit more than 30%. and the air force and the navy will only have about 10% of their goals as they start the new fiscal year. the air force usually has about 25%,” the publication notes.

multiple u.s. companies are dropping their covid-19 vaccination mandates out of desperation to get employees back to the office, according to axios.
large companies are increasingly lifting their covid-19 vaccination requirements for employees, axios reported. after covid-19-related lockdowns caused the worst global economic downturn since the great depression and july’s gdp report revealed americans are currently facing a recession again, employers are desperate to get people back in the office.
“with many tools including vaccination, improved treatments and testing now available, there is significantly less risk of severe illness,” goldman sachs told their employees in a memo obtained by axios.
goldman sachs says they’re done with covid, in spite of @nycmayor eric adam’s and @nychealthcommr ashwin vasan’s outdated and unscientific employer covid vaccine mandate. the city looks foolish in keeping this nonsensical policy. https://t.co/ynfc410xxu — covid policy wire (@covidpolicywire) september 2, 2022
it’s been nearly eight months since the u.s. supreme court struck down president joe biden’s federal mandate that all large companies force their employees to either get vaccinated against covid or be tested regularly in order to keep their jobs.
“employers are trying to reduce any barriers to entry for new hires,” erin grau, founder of charter told axios. she communicated with executives who are dropping their mandates, claiming employers believe they are “expensive and time-consuming.”
“[companies] decided that the rationale for [mandates] had become weak enough that they don’t want to continue,” jeff levin-scherz, population health leader at willis towers watson added in an interview with axios.
however, only a few companies are publicly stating their plans to drop the mandate. cisco stopped requiring vaccination in june for “office entry, travel, event attendance, or visiting customers, partners, and other third parties,” according to its website. jpmorgan chase announced in march that it would start hiring unvaccinated workers again.
some companies, including google, edelman, boeing and meta are still requiring all employees who enter their offices must be vaccinated, axios reported. (related: google to fire all unvaccinated employees)
the white house did not mention vaccine mandates in their statement released thursday, calling on businesses to take certain actions to protect employees and customers from covid-19 this fall.
jp morgan and meta did not immediately respond to the daily caller news foundation’s request for comment.

gatineau, que. -
maj.-gen. dany fortin faced cross-examination monday in the sexual assault trial against him, with both sides expected to deliver closing arguments in the case in the afternoon.
final questions for the former head of canada's covid-19 vaccine rollout focused largely on his public profile in the lead-up to his may 2021 dismissal and on his memories of military college he attended in st-jean-sur-richelieu, que.
he was also asked to explain details of the college campus at the time, including the floor plan of the barracks where students slept.
it's in one of the college dorm rooms that the complainant in the case said she was assaulted in 1988. her name is under a publication ban.
the woman told a gatineau, que. courtroom last month that she was "horrified" to wake up one night and find that a man was masturbating himself with one of her hands, while his other hand was on her breast.
she testified that after she made it known that she was awake and whispered for the attacker to "get off" her, a short struggle ensued and the intruder backed off
she said she recognized the attacker as fortin "without a doubt."
fortin has denied any guilt in the case, saying he never had physical contact with the woman or entered her room, and that they were not part of the same group of friends at college.
in court monday he reiterated that he wasn't close with the complainant.
defence lawyer isabel schurman has said she will vigorously contest the complainant's identification of her client.
during direct examination by schurman in french monday, fortin described the details of photos from the era, including one in which he identified another student with the same surname and the same nickname: "fort."
later, under questioning by crown prosecutor diane legault, fortin listed off the sports, excursions and other social activities commonly enjoyed by the recruits. he was also asked about his drinking habits at parties to which he said he would have two or three beers on a big night.
testimony from both fortin and the complainant during the first two days of the trial in september indicated that students' doors remained unlocked and that the outside doors of the barracks were generally unguarded.
the complainant's former roommate from the college told the court last month that she had no memory of an incident involving the complainant and fortin, but said she "blocked a lot of those memories out" because of her own trauma from the era.
the complainant's then-boyfriend, called to the stand by the defence, contradicted her earlier testimony that she had told him about the event right after it occurred.
fortin was removed from the vaccine campaign in may 2021 after an investigation into the allegation was launched, and he is challenging the removal separately in federal court.
military police referred the investigation to the civilian system later that month and he was charged with one count of sexual assault in august last year.
the case is being heard by judge richard meredith.
this report by the canadian press was first published oct. 24, 2022.

three cadets at the us air force academy who have refused the covid-19 vaccine will not be commissioned as military officers but will graduate with bachelor’s degrees, the academy said saturday.
academy spokesman dean miller said that a fourth cadet who had refused the vaccine until about a week ago, decided to be vaccinated and will graduate and become an air force officer.
in a statement, miller said that while the three will get a degree “they will not be commissioned into the united states air force as long as they remain unvaccinated”. he added that a decision on whether to require the three to reimburse the united states for education costs in lieu of service will be made by the secretary of the air force.
as of saturday, the air force is the only military academy, so far, where cadets are not being commissioned due to vaccine refusal. all of the more than 1,000 army cadets at the us military academy at west point, new york, graduated and were commissioned as officers earlier in the day and all were vaccinated.
the naval academy in annapolis, maryland, said saturday that none of the navy or marine corps seniors there are being prevented from commissioning due to vaccine refusals. that graduation is later this week, and the air force ceremony is wednesday in colorado. ahead of that ceremony, the us air force academy board conducted its standard review of whether this year’s class had met all graduation requirements on friday.
defense secretary lloyd austin, who is the scheduled speaker at the air force graduation, last year made the covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members, including those at the military academies, saying the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force.
military leaders have argued that troops for decades have been required to get as many as 17 vaccines in order to maintain the health of the force, particularly those deploying overseas. students arriving at the military academies get a regimen of shots on their first day — such as measles, mumps and rubella - if they aren’t already vaccinated. and they routinely get flu shots in the fall.
members of congress, the military, and the public have questioned if the exemption reviews by the military services have been fair. there have been multiple lawsuits filed against the mandate, mainly centering on the fact that very few service members have been granted religious exemptions from the shots.
until the covid-19 vaccine, very few military members sought religious exemptions to any vaccines.
lt col brian maguire, an air force academy spokesman, said a week ago that all four of the cadets had been informed of the potential consequences and met with the academy’s superintendent. and he noted then that they still had time before graduation to change their minds - and one did.
the military academies for years have required students under certain circumstances to repay tuition costs if they leave during their junior or senior year. often those cases involve students with disciplinary issues or similar problems. the costs can be as much as $200,000, or more, and any final decision on repayment is made by the service secretary.
across the military, the army, navy, air force, and marine corps have discharged as many as 4,000 active duty service members for refusing the vaccine. those who flatly refuse the vaccine without seeking an exemption are still being discharged. but the courts have stalled additional discharges of service members who sought religious exemptions.
according to the military, as many as 20,000 service members have asked for religious exemptions. thousands have been denied.

https://madisonrecord.com/stories/628655660-vaccine-or-retirement-air-force-officer-with-religious-objections-sues-government-on-deadline-day
benton – lieutenant colonel carla wiese sued the u.s. air force on july 10, rather than retire for refusing vaccination.
her counsel russell newman of nokomis, fla. filed a complaint and moved for emergency relief in u.s. district court.
the air force had set july 10 as her deadline to obey.
newman named president biden, defense secretary lloyd austin, and air force secretary frank kendall as defendants.
general michael minihan of the air mobility command at scott air force base also was named as defendant.
newman quoted a statement wiese wrote when she requested an exemption, that abortion is a sin and aborted fetal cells are used in making virus vaccines.
“i am made in god’s image and nothing is to alter that,” wiese wrote.
she wrote that the vaccines alter one’s genetic makeup.
“the receipt of this shot would violate my religious beliefs as stated above and i would not be able to practice my faith as a roman catholic,” she wrote.
“my conscience and moral beliefs would be directly violated if i receive this shot.”
newman claimed col. steven richardson interviewed wiese and concluded that vaccination would cause great harm to her mental and spiritual health.
he claimed richardson found no inconsistencies between her practices and beliefs.
he claimed minihan denied her request on the basis of a compelling interest in mission accomplishment.
newman expanded wiese’s complaint to dispute the value of the vaccines.
to hammer his point, he placed “sic” in brackets after “vaccine” to indicate someone else’s mistake.
newman claimed that since vaccines can’t prevent transmission, vaccination is a moot point that can’t adversely affect unit cohesion or mission readiness.
he inserted portions of testimony from peter mccullough, who testified as a vaccine expert in a tennessee case.
mccullough swore that centers for disease control documented more than 10,000 failures before may 31 of last year, when it stopped tracking failures.
he swore that no studies demonstrated a clinical benefit in survivors or those with evidence of prior infection.
he swore vaccination doesn’t make a person less infectious or protect others. he swore that it’s dangerous to widely utilize novel biologic therapy in populations with no information from food and drug administration registration trials.
he swore the risks outweighed any theoretical benefit especially among children and adolescents.
newman claimed every procedure, surgery, medication, and vaccination must have standard right of refusal.
he claimed vaccine makers must inform potential users they have a right to refuse, and he attached a janssen fact sheet showing such a statement.
he quoted a study of adverse reactions finding pain at injection site for 93 percent, fatigue for 72 percent, headache for 69 percent, nausea and vomiting for 26 percent, and fever for 17 percent.
he claimed the food and drug administration approved license applications but has not approved any of the vaccines.
he quoted a federal regulation that no investigator may involve a human being as a research subject without informed consent.
he claimed the regulation requires an investigator to minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.
in his motion for emergency relief, he claimed defendants have no authority to mandate a product currently being tested in a clinical trial.
he claimed that even if they had authority, they would have to accommodate wiese’s sincere beliefs.
he asserted her rights to bodily integrity, personal autonomy, and freedom from restraint and interference.
“this is still the united states of america and we the people are still a free people,” he wrote.
the court clerk randomly assigned district judge staci yandle.

washington (ap) — the air force became the second military service to approve religious exemptions to the mandatory covid-19 vaccine, granting requests from nine airmen to avoid the shots, officials said tuesday.
the nine approved so far represent just a tiny fraction of the more than 6,400 requested by air force troops, and they come as other service members are challenging the lack of religious exemptions in court cases. the marine corps is the only other military service to grant any religious accommodations, allowing three so far. the army and navy have not approved any.
the services have come under criticism for their failure to grant religious exemptions, with members of congress, the military and the public questioning if the review processes have been fair. all together, the services have received more than 14,000 requests for religious exemptions.
military leaders have argued that religious exemptions to any of the many vaccines troops are required to get have been very rare over the years. service members are required to get as many as 17 different vaccines, depending on where they deploy.
a federal judge in texas granted a preliminary injunction last month, stopping the navy from acting against 35 sailors for refusing on religious grounds to comply with an order to get the covid vaccine.
eight of the air force approvals came during the initial review process, and one was granted on appeal to senior air force leaders. so far, religious exemption requests from more than 3,200 airmen were denied, and another 3,200 are pending.
“the department of the air force determined the service members’ accommodations could be supported with no impact to mission readiness,” the statement tuesday said.
defense secretary lloyd austin and military leaders have argued that the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force. and all of the services have now either discharged personnel for refusing the vaccine, or put a system in place to do so.
the marine corps has discharged 469, the air force has discharged 179 and the navy has discharged 118, according to data released in the last week. the number include active-duty personnel and entry-level recruits who were still in boot camp. the army has issued more than 3,000 formal letters of reprimand, and fired six soldiers, but has not discharged anyone yet.
all the military services have said the exemption decisions are based not only on the individual request, but also on its impact on the unit, its mission and readiness, and the health and safety of other troops.
those who get an exemption and are allowed to stay in the service may, however, see an impact on their jobs.
the navy and the marine corps have said unvaccinated service members are not allowed to deploy out to sea on ships, where infections can more easily spread. those who have approved exemptions — either medical, administrative or religious — are assigned to shore duties.
at least 97% of the troops in each service have gotten at least one shot.

https://www.thedailybeast.com/rand-paul-ophthalmology-certification-scandal-why-it-matters
scarcely a day passes that we don’t find out something new and objectionable about dr. rand paul. the risk in the pile-on is that a real doozie will get missed, lost in the daily torrent. the recent news—his lack of standard certification as an ophthalmologist and its relationship to his self-anointing and self-created national board of ophthalmology—is just such a big deal. its specifics, however, are so complicated and unrewarding to follow as to threaten to place it on the endangered scandal list.
i am here to make certain that we don’t let this one slide. his decision to sidestep the standard way doctors are certified in america is—even by summer politician standards—slimy, lazy, self-serving, and, important to remember as we sink deeper into his muck, revealing of the real reason for his me-against-the-man shtick. (hint: he’s not looking out for you, mr. little guy). but before we read from the latest entry of the randiad, let me guide you through the mind-numbing world of american physician credentialing.
trying to gin up a moral issue out of the selfish power play is reminiscent of nixon’s view of the law as something to try to outsmart. it’s also disrespectful to the oddball but often courageous stances of his father and other giants of the right willing to fight on principle.
here’s how it works: to practice medicine legally requires a license issued by the state. eligibility for licensure is granted after graduating medical school and after passing a series of difficult standardized exams prepared by the national board of medical examiners. once completed, licensure is forever (assuming a person behaves and isn’t a total disaster). rand is a licensed physician.
but a guy's got to practice medicine somewhere—an eye specialist like dr. paul, for example, needs a hospital's operating rooms to ply his trade. and that's where certification comes in. whereas licensure is a one-size-fits-all blanket of general adequacy, certification is granted by a specialty board to indicate competency in a specific field such as ophthalmology (or medicine or surgery or psychiatry). certification tests long have been administered by venerable, apolitical groups such as the american board of ophthalmology (or internal medicine or whatever). the certificate is a national credential that, although not absolutely necessary to practice medicine, is more or less required for any doctor seeking an affiliation with a hospital.
it gets even more complicated, but hang in there; rand is hoping the distinctions are just too subtle for anyone to really care about. in the 1980s, american medicine decided that it should police itself. a little. so the grand old men of the various fields decided that already certified specialists should recertify once a decade. rand initially did the right thing and became certified; but when his 10 years were up, he decided he’d had enough and chose not to recertify. rather, he organized his own certifying program for ophthalmology based right there in his hometown of bowling green. he then appointed himself president of the group, which he named the national board of ophthalmologists, and better yet, declared his wife (not a doctor) vp and his father-in-law secretary. talk about convenient! it remains unclear what the nbo criteria for certification are; the organization appears to have no website or easily located documents (though it is registered with the state of kentucky as a nonprofit and claims to have certified a few hundred eye doctors).
all of this would be ok with me; i just took the frigging recertification test in my field and i hated every minute of it. it is humiliating and infuriating and insulting and a waste of time and money. indeed, i applaud rand’s sticking his tongue out at the gasbags who insist on teenage procedures (multiple-choice tests proctored now by cybersecurity) to assure that a doctor is certified in his field.
but rand lost me when he articulated the reason why he resisted. being a conscientious objector or pissed off adult simply wasn’t good enough. no, he decided to cast it as a high-end moral stance against groups that discriminate—groups like the american board of ophthalmology. and what exactly was their discriminatory practice? opposing civil rights maybe? nope—much, much worse. the old geezers who made up the test requirements built a nice little loophole for themselves: they excluded themselves from having to recertify—instead they were “grandfathered” in. and in so doing they discriminated against poor rand and me and thousands of other of victimized doctors. thank goodness someone had the strength to make a stand against the nefarious two-tiered system. ah the pure horseshit—true kentucky thoroughbred stuff.
trying to gin up a moral issue out of the selfish power play is reminiscent of nixon’s view of the law as something to try to outsmart. it’s also disrespectful to the oddball but often courageous stances of his father and other giants of the right willing to fight on principle. with his creation of a ludicrous home-brew “certifying board,” he has shown his dedication not to a movement but to the single goal of making life a little bit more convenient for rand paul. and here paul does appear to speak for his generation: he has given us the finest example yet of yuppie selfishness in senescence.
correction: an earlier version of this story incorrectly said that the national board of medical examiners was roughly the equivalent of the american bar association.

at this moment, the united states navy is preparing to deploy a 10,000-ton warship carrying 320 officers and sailors, along with missiles, torpedoes, and a mounted artillery gun. this ship, known as a guided-missile destroyer, defends the united states and its allies on the seas. although its next mission remains secret, it may bolster american military presence in europe as russian aggression pushes the continent into war. but the navy cannot currently deploy this warship, because it has lost trust in its commanding officer, an anti-vaxxer who has repeatedly disobeyed lawful orders, misled superiors, and allegedly exposed dozens of his crew to covid-19 due to a refusal to get tested.
advertisement
the navy wants to remove this officer, whom i’ll call john doe, from command of the destroyer. but it can’t, because a single federal judge in tampa has forbidden it. this judge has overruled multiple admirals and captains who assert, under oath, that deploying the ship with doe in charge would imperil national security. he instead ordered the navy, under threat of sanction, to keep this disobedient officer in charge of a $1.8 billion warship. the federal judiciary is quite literally preventing the nation from defending itself at sea.
advertisement
advertisement
advertisement
that judge, steven douglas merryday, is a george h.w. bush nominee who sits on a federal trial court in florida. he gained notoriety in 2021 after blocking a cdc order that limited cruise ship operations due to the pandemic. so, when the far-right liberty counsel sought to halt president joe biden’s covid-19 vaccine mandate for the armed forces, they took their case to merryday’s court. predictably, they prevailed: in february, merryday ruled that the mandate violated the religious freedom restoration act, siding with the plaintiffs, navy commander john doe and lieutenant colonel jane smith. (i’ve applied these pseudonyms to the officers because the court granted them anonymity.)
advertisement
but merryday did not merely exempt doe and smith from the mandate. rather, he handed down a sweeping restraining order that prohibited the navy from taking any “adverse action” against the plaintiffs because of their unvaccinated status. specifically, he barred the navy from reassigning them for any reason whatsoever.
this order created immediate problems. an active-duty member of the marine corps, smith is slated to take command of a combat logistics battalion later this year. as lieutenant general w.m. jurney attested, this commander must disembark at ally nations all over the world. many of these countries require all u.s. service members to be vaccinated against covid before stepping on their shores. because she is unvaccinated, smith is not “worldwide deployable,” in jurney’s words. and yet merryday has forced the navy to deploy her.
advertisement
advertisement
but doe poses the bigger threat. he is currently the commanding officer of a warship that may soon set sail. if he falls seriously ill at sea—which is more likely because he refuses the vaccine—he may thwart the entire mission. the issue, however, goes deeper than that. in declarations, vice admiral d.w. dwyer and captain frank brandon explained that doe’s anti-vax beliefs are part of a broader pattern of insubordination. brandon testified that last november, he spoke with doe on doe’s ship one day before its scheduled departure. doe was experiencing multiple symptoms of covid, and appeared to have a relatively severe case; he could, brandon recalled, “barely speak.” yet doe refused to get tested—a clear violation of protocol—and attended a briefing in a cramped room with about 60 other people. brandon ordered doe to get a test, which revealed that he did, indeed, have covid, and exposed dozens of others to the virus.
advertisement
advertisement
doe engaged in other deceptive behavior. for instance, when requesting leave, he concealed the fact that he was flying to another state, which would have triggered a mandatory risk assessment. after brandon discovered this subterfuge, he learned that doe had traveled to a high-risk area, requiring five days’ quarantine upon return. doe did not inform his executive officer of this extended absence, creating a “significant and very rare” disruption “across the waterfront” during a crucial phase of ship preparation. brandon concluded that doe “intentionally deceived me,” “put his crew at risk,” “failed to comply with the navy’s covid-19 policies,” and engaged in “negligent behavior” in “performance of his duties.”
advertisement
advertisement
“i do not trust [doe] with the lives of our sailors,” brandon testified. he continued:

i am responsible for the well-being of my squadron, including welfare of my ships and the health of my sailors. my loss of confidence in [doe] is … based on the fact that i cannot trust his judgment, i cannot trust him to look after the welfare of his sailors, and i cannot trust him to be honest with me. in my judgment, allowing him to remain in command of a navy warship would be reckless.
brandon’s view is shared across the navy. in dwyer’s alarming declaration, the vice admiral explained that doe would constitute a “manifest national security concern” if he remains a commanding officer. “it is untenable that a subordinate commander may choose to disregard, modify, or half-heartedly execute a senior officer’s orders due to his or her personal beliefs,” dwyer testified. this insubordination “degrades mission effectiveness and the ability of the strike group to perform its mission in the interest of u.s. national security.”

merryday’s order, dwyer noted, “requires the navy to leave a subordinate commander in command of a warship, despite his senior officer’s questions relating to his fitness to discharge his duties as ordered. under no circumstances would the navy typically deploy a commander in an operational capacity with whom his or her superior officers have such reservations.”

in light of these fears, the department of justice pleaded with merryday to pause his decision. on wednesday, he declined. merryday scorned the notion that doe might get sick, writing that he is “triumphantly fit and slim and strong.” he also implied that navy leadership may be lying about doe’s insubordination in retaliation against his religious beliefs. merryday declined to fully credit their testimony until he could subject them to cross-examination. he concluded that the plaintiffs’ right to religious liberty trumps the navy’s profound national security concerns.

the navy and the federal judiciary are therefore in a standoff. the navy will not deploy doe’s warship until he is stripped of command. merryday will not allow it to do so. as a result, merryday has effectively taken a 10,000 ton, $1.8 billion guided-missile destroyer out of commission. as the navy builds up its naval presence in europe to guard against further russian aggression, it is down a ship—solely because an unelected judge in tampa has inserted himself into the chain of command.
this situation is untenable. already, a texas judge, abetted by the 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals, has freed nearly three dozen seals from the vaccine mandate, a decision that high-ranking officers say will put the world at risk. now merryday is holding back a warship from deployment—and the judicial resistance to military mandate is just beginning. these cases are on a fast-track to the supreme court. if the justices do not confirm that judges must respect the commander-in-chief’s lawful orders, thousands of other service members like doe will unleash chaos on the armed forces.

“the adjutant general of florida says the defense department’s covid-19 vaccine mandate seriously threatens military readiness,” the national guard association of the united states (ngaus) reported earlier this month.
“maj. gen. james o. eifert adds making american troops get the vaccine endangers national security.”
“i’ve never been more worried about the future of the u.s. armed forces than i am right now,” he said in a wall street journal op-ed published in august.
“one of the military’s most foundational duties is to recruit and retain men and women willing to defend their country,” eifert added.
“unfortunately, current federal policy is rendering that goal unobtainable.”
there was an important piece in the wsj last week from maj. gen. james eifert. the pentagon continues to undermine the readiness of our armed forces by dismissing tens of thousands of service members because of its morally corrupt vaccine mandate. https://t.co/vag67nruiu — mick mcguire (@generalmcguire) august 10, 2022
from ngaus:
eifert is thought to be the first general officer to speak out on the vaccine mandate, doing so in his capacity as a state official. eifert’s byline didn’t include his rank. he decried the dod requirement’s potential impact on guardsmen across the u.s. “the army secretary’s deadline for all reserve component soldiers to be vaccinated expired on june 30, leaving almost 40,000 national guard members and 20,000 army reservists nationwide at risk of involuntary termination,” he argued. “my florida national guard formations face the potential loss of about 1,000 unvaccinated guardsmen out of 12,000 total airmen and soldiers,” eifert continued. “that leaves us shorthanded as our state enters hurricane season, while more than 1,000 soldiers and airmen are also deployed on federal missions around the world.” eifert claimed the vaccine policy comes amid domestic recruiting and retention struggles and rising global tensions. “only 23% of recruitment-age americans meet eligibility requirements, and fewer still are even interested,” he noted. “why should we further damage military readiness by discharging honorably serving military members and shunning unvaccinated new recruits?” “our world is only becoming more dangerous,” eifert concluded. “i’m hopeful than an open-minded self-assessment leads to a solution that addresses this most serious threat to force readiness – before it’s too late.”
“we cannot adequately support the state’s citizens on florida’s [hypothetical] worst day with the size of our national guard at this point,” air force maj. gen. james eifert, florida national guard adjutant general, testified to the florida senate.https://t.co/gfu73f1oz2 pic.twitter.com/2giihchbar — military times (@militarytimes) january 28, 2021
army guardsmen and army reservists had until june 30 to get fully or partially vaccinated against covid-19.
since july 1, the unvaccinated members of both components have been forbidden from federally funded drills, trainings and other duties.
“army data released last week shows 88% of the army national guard is fully vaccinated against covid-19, while another 1.6% has received one dose of the vaccine,” ngaus added.
“while 9,795 army guardsmen have refused the vaccine, the service hasn’t separated anyone.”

pfizer’s covid-19 vaccine, which was developed with biontech, was approved by the who for use globally on 31 december 2020. credit: shutterstock.
latin american countries have accused pfizer of ‘high-level bullying’ during covid-19 vaccine negotiations, according to a report by the bureau of investigative journalism published in partnership with stat.
government officials from argentina and another latin american country, which has signed a confidentiality agreement with pfizer and so cannot be named, told the bureau that pfizer demanded additional indemnity against civil lawsuits citizens might file in relation to pfizer’s covid-19 vaccine.
pfizer reportedly asked governments in argentina and brazil to put up sovereign assets, including military bases and federal bank reserves, as collateral for potential future legal costs.
although most countries have offered indemnity to vaccine manufacturers in the pandemic, these latin american government officials felt pfizer’s demands went beyond those of other companies or the covax facility.
according to government officials in argentina and the unnamed country, pfizer asked for liability protection not only against civil claims from citizens who suffer serious adverse events after being vaccinated, but also for cases brought due to pfizer’s own negligence, fraud or malice. documents from brazil’s ministry of health suggest that pfizer made similar demands of the brazilian government.
as a result of these demands, neither argentina nor brazil signed a vaccine supply deal with pfizer. the other unnamed country eventually came to an agreement with pfizer, but with a three-month delay, to the detriment of the government’s ability to get on top of the covid-19 crisis.
world health organization (who) center on national and global health law director professor lawrence gostin told the bureau: “pharmaceutical companies shouldn’t be using their power to limit life-saving vaccines in low and middle-income countries. [this] seems to be exactly what they’re doing.
“some liability protection is warranted, but certainly not for fraud, gross negligence, mismanagement, failure to follow good manufacturing practices. companies have no right to ask for indemnity for these things.”
in an emailed statement to pharmaceutical technology, pfizer said itself and biontech, with which it developed the covid-19 vaccine, “are firmly committed to working with governments and other relevant stakeholders to ensure equitable and affordable access to our covid-19 vaccine for people around the world.”
“globally, we have also allocated doses to low- and lower-middle-income countries at a not-for-profit price, including an advance purchase agreement with covax to provide up to 40 million doses in 2021.
“since the beginning of our vaccine development program, we have been in talks with more than 100 countries and supranational organizations, including in latin america, regarding the supply of our covid-19 vaccine. we are committed to supporting efforts aimed at providing developing countries with the same access to vaccines as the rest of the world.
“we will not comment on ongoing negotiations, which are private and confidential.”
pfizer has signed vaccine supply agreements with nine latin american and caribbean countries to date: chile, colombia, costa rica, the dominican republic, ecuador, mexico, panama, peru and uruguay.
these revelations occur in the context of richer countries being criticised for inequitably hoarding available covid-19 vaccine doses at the expense of poorer developing countries. who director-general dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus has declared the world to be “on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure” due to the stark inequity in access to covid-19 vaccines.
vaccine companies have also faced criticism for focusing on bilateral negotiations with richer countries, rather than on signing deals with the covax facility, the equitable covid-19 vaccine access programme run by the who, the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations and gavi, the vaccine alliance.
some healthcare charities have called for companies to share intellectual property and technical know-how to allow covid-19 vaccines to be developed by other manufacturers across the world.
latin america has been hit extremely hard by the covid-19 pandemic. brazil has the third-highest number of cases worldwide and the second-largest number of deaths in the world, according to the john hopkins university coronavirus resource center. access to safe and effective vaccines in the region would be invaluable for turning the tide of the region’s covid-19 crisis.
the company’s covid-19 vaccine, which was developed with biontech, was approved by the who for use globally on 31 december 2020.

https://www.theepochtimes.com/significant-proof-air-force-has-discriminated-against-troops-seeking-religious-exemptions-to-vaccine-mandate-court_4726307.html
air force members seeking religious exemptions from the u.s. military's covid-19 vaccine mandate have provided "significant proof" that the service branch has discriminated against them, a federal appeals court ruled on sept. 12.
a three-judge panel of the u.s. court of appeals for the 6th circuit said in its decision that plaintiffs had to provide significant proof that the air force had a policy to deny all requests for religious exemptions, and all indications are that they have.
"to establish a general policy ... the plaintiffs need not show that the department rejects 100% of requests for religious exemptions. and the department’s own statistics show that, as of may 23, 2022, it had rejected more than 99% of them," u.s. circuit judge raymond kethledge, a george w. bush appointee, wrote in the 11-page order.
"that the department has granted only a comparative handful of religious exemptions, while granting thousands of medical and administrative ones, is itself at this stage of the case significant proof of discrimination."
kethledge was joined by circuit judges eric murphy and john k. bush, both trump appointees.
a u.s. district court in july blocked the mandate for thousands of air force members who remain unvaccinated and have had their religious exemptions denied or not acted upon. in response, the government asked for an emergency stay. when that was denied, the government went to the appeals court, arguing that the ruling was wrong.
plaintiffs
the plaintiffs are all members who sought religious exemptions and were deemed by chaplains to hold sincere religious beliefs, although the military still rejected many of their requests. the others haven't received final decisions but expect to be rejected, based on the treatment of like-minded airmen.
the group has said that evidence shows the military systemically denied requests for religious exemptions, denying federal law and the u.s. constitution.
“this order by the court of appeals affirms that the department of defense and the air force violated religious free exercise rights of service members which is protected under the religious freedom restoration act and the first amendment," mat staver, founder and chairman of liberty counsel, which is representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement.
"this is a great victory for religious freedom, especially for these air force service members who love god and love america. these mandates will continue to crumble one by one in the courts."
the latest ruling upholds u.s. district court judge matthew mcfarland's aug. 19 order, which rejected the military's request for an emergency stay and extended through the duration of the legal battle the preliminary injunction against taking punitive action against the estimated more than 12,000 air force members who want religious exemptions.
the court did expedite the air force's appeal of the class-wide preliminary injunction, directing the department to file its first brief within two weeks, plaintiffs to file within two weeks after that, and the air force to reply to that response within seven days. oral arguments are scheduled for oct. 19; a decision is expected in november.

the canadian armed forces says it is investigating after one of its officers appeared in a video speaking out against vaccine mandates.
maj. stephen chledowski is the latest serving member of the canadian military to have spoken out against government-ordered mandates and restrictions intended to curb the spread and severity of covid-19.
a video of chledowski in uniform appeared on social media thursday, as hundreds of anti-vaccine mandate protesters continue to occupy parts of downtown ottawa and block border crossings in other parts of the country.
it also came as hundreds of serving military personnel face the threat of forced removal from the armed forces for refusing to get their shots.
defence department spokesman daniel le bouthillier confirmed friday morning that the military was aware of the video and that what he described as "appropriate action" would be taken. le bouthillier did not say what that appropriate action might be, including whether criminal charges could be laid.
the military last year charged another officer with mutiny after he allegedly urged other members of the canadian armed forces not to help with the distribution of covid-19 vaccines.

https://worldnewsguru.us/politics/attorney-discusses-latest-updates-on-lawsuits-brought-by-more-than-1100-active-duty-military-officers-against-unlawful-vaccine-mandate/453966/
on tuesday morning, this reporter from the gateway pundit attended a press conference focused on two lawsuits filed on behalf of more than 1,100 active duty military officers to fight the forced and unlawful covid vaccine mandate in the military.
representing the plaintiffs is attorney dale saran who, in 2000, defended three u.s. service members who refused the anthrax vaccine.
saran is again coming to the legal defense of our troops fighting the unlawful covide vaccine mandate in court.
in his opening remarks, saran shared information about the anthrax court battle and the eua (emergency use authorization)statute and its relation to the current vaccine mandate battle. “that statute had just been passed, it was called the project bio-shield, and the first eua vaccine was in fact the anthrax vaccine. it was made voluntary because of that litigation. and yet, less than 15 years later, here came the dod and now we have another unlicensed product and we are going to have to shove it into the arms of our military folks.”

“it’s important to understand really that’s at the heart of most of the legal claims we have advanced, and that i have advanced on behalf of these military members… there is no licensed vaccine. and i know it’s convenient, and i don’t blame anybody in the media, because they have fallen for the fda’s propaganda campaign, but the day that the day that the fda licensed comirnaty, august 23rd of 2021, the same day, it removed it from the market. so if you look at the marketing beginning and end date of commodity you will find it can not be sold in the united states because it was removed from the us market the same day it was licensed.” “and it would be good if maybe we started asking some hard questions about people at the fda and the dod who knew this because it was, not withstanding, it was removed from the market on august 23rd, the next day august 24th, the secretary of defense announced that they were going to go forward with this vaccine program, only for licensed products…of course that they didn’t have. and yet the program rolled forward and what the dod did was, as many of the folks here know, the under secretary of defense for health affairs, terry adirim, published a memo claiming that the unlicensed product, bnt162b2, pfizer’s unlicensed eua product, could be substituted in, that it was interchangeable with the licensed product. and that’s the fraud that’s at the heart of our case, and that’s the fraud that heart of why these products have been forced on an unwilling and unsuspecting public.”
on may 23, in the eastern district of texas, saran filed a lawsuit on behalf of multiple services members alleging that the pentagon’s vaccine mandate issued by secretary of defense lloyd austin on aug. 24, 2021, was unconstitutional and therefore unlawful. defendants in the case include lloyd austin, secretary of the u.s. department of defense. janet woodcock acting commissioner of the food and drug administration, and xavier becerra secretary of the department of health and human services.
the complaint alleges that austin and the dod are “coercing and forcing military members to be injected with unlicensed drugs in violation of federal law and the u.s. constitution.”
the lawsuit contends: plaintiffs allege that the order to receive these non-vaccines is unconstitutional and unlawful ab initio because it mandates the injection of unlicensed, experimental products without informed consent, namely, the mrna covid-19 therapeutics developed by pfizer/biontech and moderna. this right to be free from being experimented upon against one’s will has been codified in multiple federal statutes requiring informed consent for any mandated use of an “unlicensed product.” see 10 u.s.c. § 1107a, and 21 u.s.c. § 360bbb- 3 (collectively, the “informed consent laws”).1 the supreme court has also long held that the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment is a fundamental human right.
additionally, the filing notes that the centers for disease control and prevention intentionally changed its own definitions of ‘vaccine’ and ‘vaccinations’ overnight on sept. 1, 2021, to eliminate the word ‘immunity’”—the entire point of a vaccination as a public health measure.

saran has also filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of more than 130 u.s. coast guard members alleging the religious exemptions they filed in response to the biden administration’s covid-19 vaccine mandate for military service members were unlawfully denied.
on july 25, in the u.s. district court for the southern district of texas galveston division, saran filed the suit challenging the constitutionality of the mandate for members of the u.s. coast guard.
defendants in the case include alejandro mayorkas, secretary of the u.s. department of homeland security, linda l. fagan, commandant of the coast guard, lloyd austin, secretary of the u.s. department of defense and dr. janet woodcock, acting commissioner of the u.s. food and drug administration.
the suit alleges:
because of their vaccination status, plaintiffs have been harassed, treated differently than their peers, singled out publicly by their leaders, had their normal leave and liberty restricted, been removed from senior/leadership positions, been denied promotion, received official discipline, been barred from training, travel, new assignments and permanent change of station (‘pcs’) orders, and face imminent involuntary separation, all while they have continued to perform the mission alongside their ‘vaccinated’ peers, in many cases, while their ‘vaccinated’ peers got sick with covid-19 in large numbers.” the plaintiffs allege the dod and coast guard mandates violate several federal statutes and regulations and the u.s. constitution. moreover, the lawsuit alleges that the plaintiffs’ rars and appeals have been summarily dismissed with “formulaic language” and “nearly identical form letters” instead of “individualized evaluation.” in addition, “none of the [original] 122 plaintiffs who filed an rar received their response within the required 30-day deadline.”

three brave active military officers, speaking as individuals and not representing the official position of the department of defense or their individual branches, joined saran to share their stories and experiences.
their willingness to risk their careers, promotions and advancements is a powerful statement on their efforts to protect their fellow service members as well as the american people.

president joe biden on thursday said he has ordered the military to start taking steps toward making the covid-19 vaccine mandatory for uniformed service members.
in comments at the white house, biden stopped short of imposing a vaccine mandate right away. but he said he has asked the defense department to look into how, and when, the military will add vaccines to protect against covid-19 to the list of other vaccinations service members must receive.
biden said making the vaccines mandatory is important because troops often serve in places where vaccination rates are low and covid is prevalent.

"men and women in uniform, who protect this country against grave threats, should be protected as much as possible from getting covid-19," he said.
covid vaccines are now available on an emergency use basis. until the food and drug administration issues full approval for the vaccines, the military has said it will not make them mandatory for service members.
when asked whether defense secretary lloyd austin is open to mandating troop vaccinations before the vaccine is fully approved by the fda, biden said, "i know he's open to it.
"the question is, when is the right time to get the most bang for the buck," biden continued. "a lot of this is timing. i think it's going to happen, but ... it's still a temporary approval."
biden said he would not pressure health agencies to come to any conclusions on approving the vaccine, but said he thinks they will reach their conclusions in early fall.
vaccination rates are slowing in the military, as they are in other spots around the country. in mid-july, austin said that 70% of active-duty troops had received at least one shot of a vaccine, and 62% were fully vaccinated.
the pentagon's covid website said that more than 1 million service members are fully vaccinated, and another 233,000 are partially vaccinated. that equates to at least 60% of the total military force of roughly 2.1 million -- including active, guard and reserve troops -- who are at least partially vaccinated, though not all guard and reserve troops who have been vaccinated may be recorded in those numbers.
biden's directive, along with other initiatives he unveiled that are intended to encourage and make it easier for civilians to get vaccinated, come as vaccination rates are slowing and concerns are spreading about a more transmissible coronavirus mutation called the delta variant.
after the centers for disease control and prevention earlier this week recommended that even fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas of the country where the virus is rapidly spreading, the military followed suit.
the highly trafficked pentagon also reimposed its own mask mandates, even though its location in arlington, virginia, is seeing only moderate covid spread overall.
in his remarks at the white house, biden decried the way covid vaccines have become politicized by some, and praised senate minority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., and republican alabama gov. kay ivey for encouraging citizens of their states to get the shots.
"this is not about red states and blue states, it's literally about life and death," biden said. "i know people talk about freedom. i learned growing up ... with freedom comes responsibility. the decision to be unvaccinated impacts someone else. unvaccinated people spread the virus. ... so please, exercise responsible judgment. get vaccinated.
"it's an american blessing that we have vaccines for each and every american," he continued. "it's such a shame to squander that blessing."
correction: this story has been updated to correct a reference to the military’s policy on vaccines before fda approval.

the u.s. army is hemorrhaging people.
the army’s vice chief of staff, gen. joseph m. martin, confirmed at a house armed services subcommittee on readiness hearing on tuesday that the regular army is poised to fall nearly 19,000 soldiers short of its staffing target, or end strength, in fiscal 2022.
looking ahead to fiscal 2023, martin essentially said the service will be lucky to fall only 18,000 short of its goal.
shortfalls in recruiting and retaining national guard and army reserve personnel were not specified at the hearing. but similar shortfalls in hitting a target of 525,000 army reservists would come on top of the missing regular army soldiers.
“that’s alarming,” said rep. jackie speier, who chairs the house armed services subcommittee on personnel, referring to the end strength shortfalls at tuesday’s hearing.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/military-vaccine-mandate-challenge-1.6287451
the federal court heard arguments wednesday from four canadian armed forces members facing disciplinary action for refusing to get vaccinated against covid-19.
chief of the defence staff gen. wayne eyre ordered all armed forces members to be vaccinated by the end of november; those who do not will face remedial measures, including the prospect of dismissal from the military. that deadline has since been extended to dec. 18.
the order follows a similar requirement for all federal public servants. eyre has also said his order is intended to protect the military during the pandemic.
in sworn affidavits, the four service members challenging the order say they are opposed to getting the vaccine for different reasons, including concerns about its long-term safety and religious grounds.
"i do not have the confidence in the government's declaration that they are 'safe and effective,"' lt.-col. illo antonio neri states. "more specifically, i do not believe the trials have accurately discovered and assessed all potential long-term effects of the vaccines."
and while eyre's order allows for exemptions on medical, religious and human rights grounds, edmonton lawyer catherine christensen, who represented the four military members in court on wednesday, told the canadian press their requests were all rejected.
the four service members argue that their constitutional rights are being violated and the threat of dismissal is extreme.
"during my time in caf, i have seen members convicted of serious offences and not removed from service," warrant officer morgan christopher warren states in his affidavit.
government lawyers have submitted hundreds of pages of documents to support their arguments that vaccines are safe and effective. they have also argued that if the four service members are unhappy, they should file a grievance with the military.
but christensen argues that would be inappropriate because the order was handed down by the military's top commander. if the federal court grants her request for a temporary injunction, she plans to apply for the court to hear the case in full.
federal court judge janet fuhrer reserved judgment following several hours of arguments on wednesday, christensen told the canadian press.
military has 98% vaccination uptake
the four armed forces members aren't the first to challenge federal vaccine requirements. earlier this month, the federal court refused to grant an injunction for dozens of federal bureaucrats who are also facing dismissal for having refused to get the shot.
department of national defence spokesperson daniel le bouthillier said approximately 98 per cent of service members have reported being vaccinated, and most of those who haven't are reservists or people on leave.
another 800 members have applied for medical, religious or human rights exemptions, though le bouthillier could not say how many had been approved as officials are continuing to push more people to get vaccinated before the dec. 18 deadline.
le bouthillier said the military will not dismiss any members "until remedial measures have been exhausted," and that the first of those forced dismissals is not expected until january due to "necessary administrative delays in the process."
"at any point during the process," he added, "members can change their mind and get vaccinated, at which time the member becomes compliant with the cds directive and the conclusion of remedial measures should be considered."

new delhi, feb 5 (reuters) - pfizer inc (pfe.n) said on friday it had withdrawn an application for emergency-use authorisation of its covid-19 vaccine in india, after failing to meet the drug regulator's demand for a local safety and immunogenicity study.
the decision means the vaccine will not be available for sale in the world's two most populous countries, india and china, in the near future. both countries are running their immunisation campaigns using other products.
unlike other companies conducting small studies in india for foreign-developed vaccines, pfizer had sought an exception citing approvals it had received elsewhere based on trials done in countries such as the united states and germany. read more
indian health officials say they generally ask for so-called bridging trials to determine if a vaccine is safe and generates an immune response in its citizens. there are, however, provisions under india's rules to waive such trials in certain conditions.
the u.s. company, which was the first drugmaker to seek emergency approval in india for its vaccine developed with germany's biontech (22uay.de), made the withdrawal decision after a meeting with india's central drugs standard control organisation (cdsco) on wednesday.
the drug regulator said on its website its experts did not recommend the vaccine because of side effects reported abroad were still being investigated. it also said pfizer had not proposed any plan to generate safety and immunogenicity data in india.
"based on the deliberations at the meeting and our understanding of additional information that the regulator may need, the company has decided to withdraw its application at this time," pfizer said in a statement.
"pfizer will continue to engage with the authority and re-submit its approval request with additional information as it becomes available in the near future."
reuters was the first to break the news. read more
pfizer had sought authorisation for its vaccine in india late last year, but the government in january approved two much cheaper shots - one from oxford university/astrazeneca (azn.l) and another developed in india by bharat biotech with the indian council of medical research.
both companies had applied for approval of their vaccines after pfizer, and their trials are ongoing in india. local company dr. reddy's laboratories ltd (redy.ns) is running trials for russia's sputnik v vaccine, which is expected to be approved this month or next. read more

as the pentagon begins processing immediate discharges for those who object to the covid-19 ‘vaccines’ to leave the u.s. military, there is new data to support extraordinary concern for the shots’ safety.
disturbing new data from the defense medical epidemiology database shows a startling increase in numerous medical health conditions year-over-year for all age-cohorts — some of these conditions being chronic and life-threatening.
it was first brought to public light in a february 1, 2022 letter to pentagon chief lloyd austin from the u.s. senate. senator ron johnson cited the “dramatic increases in medical diagnoses among military personnel,” as well as evidence “diagnoses of myocarditis had been removed from the database.”
dr. aaron kheriarty of the ethics and public policy center shared a copy of the letter:
keep an eye on this story as it develops. i presented at the senate panel where renz presented this disturbing data. pic.twitter.com/aqkqhrhkg8 — aaron kheriaty, md (@akheriaty) february 8, 2022
below are summarized 2021 (with vaccines) numbers with percentage changes relative to 2020 (without vaccines), as recently noted by mrna vaccine expert dr. robert malone.

instead of responding to senator ron johnson, the dod contacted discredited, partisan “fact checker” politifact:
“but peter graves, spokesperson for the defense health agency’s armed forces surveillance division, told politifact by email that “in response to concerns mentioned in news reports” the division reviewed data in the dmed “and found that the data was incorrect for the years 2016-2020.” officials compared numbers in the dmed with source data in the dmss and found that the total number of medical diagnoses from those years “represented only a small fraction of actual medical diagnoses.” the 2021 numbers, however, were up-to-date, giving the “appearance of significant increased occurrence of all medical diagnoses in 2021 because of the underreported data for 2016-2020,” graves said. the dmed system has been taken offline to “identify and correct the root-cause of the data corruption,” graves said.
thus, similarly to vaers, when the data do not support authoritarian measures, the data ‘can’t be trusted.’ when they do support government coercion, the data is as infallible as “the science.”
thomas renz’s website renz law, however, shows that the department of defense appears to be fiddling with the data to allay concerns about vaccines and its misguided mandate.
dr. robert malone had some pointed questions about the dod’s purported explanation for the huge spike in cases”
so, what do the original data show (prior to defense health agency’s armed forces surveillance division correction of the “data corruption”). in reviewing these data, what we see are baseline data from 2016 to 2019 (pre sars-cov-2/covid-19), 2020 (the first year of sars-cov-2/covid-19 when no vaccines were available), and 2021 (the year that vaccines were available and mandated for the us military). as noted above, there are many potential confounding variables, but whatever the cause, if these data are not due to longstanding and previously undiscovered “data corruption”, then we have a major issue with the overall health of our armed services. and if they are due to previously undiscovered “data corruption”, why wasn’t someone running around with their pants on fire trying to figure out what is going on here long before the whistleblowers brought this to national attention?
a u.s. federal district court judge in early february halted the department of defense’s rejection of soldiers’ exemption requests on religious objection grounds, and went even further by stating that the objectors’ case is likely to prevail upon appeal.
“finally, the military is most likely unable to establish, and certainly has not established, that permitting the relatively small number of rfra objectors, even if every request for exemption (much less the two at issue in this motion) were sincere and successful, to serve without adverse consequences to their standing and the terms and conditions of their service will adversely affect the public’s interest in the maintenance and readiness of the nation’s military forces,” judge steven d. merryday ruled.
“in fact, the public undoubtedly has some considerable interest in maintaining the services of skilled, experienced, highly trained, patriotic, courageous, and esteemed service members, such as the two moving service members, in whom the public has an immense financial investment and who are not, to say the least, readily replaceable,” the judge added.
every u.s. service-member deserves such respect, particularly as the vaccines have failed to slow the spread of the disease, and according to an initial reading of the department of defense’s own data, is leading to an explosion of adverse effects cases.

the food and drug administration granted emergency authorization to pfizer and biontech's coronavirus vaccine on friday.
the two-dose vaccine is the first to be authorized in the us, though moderna's coronavirus vaccine will likely receive fda authorization this month as well.
after months of testing, the vaccine was found to be 95% effective in preventing covid-19 in a large-scale trial. its development process was unprecedentedly fast — no other vaccine in history has been created and manufactured so quickly. previously, the fastest vaccine ever developed took more than four years.
but perhaps most remarkably, biontech co-founder ugur sahin designed the vaccine in just a few hours in mid-january, according to the journal, a podcast from gimlet and the wall street journal.
advertisement
advertisement
a biontech spokesperson confirmed to business insider that sahin — who founded the company with his wife, özlem türeci — made a "rough design over one weekend."
moderna's vaccine also took just two days to design, as business insider previously reported. the reason both candidates could be designed so quickly comes down to the technology they rely on: messenger rna, or mrna.
the fda had never approved an mrna-based vaccine or treatment before. but now that the agency has granted authorization to pfizer and biontech — with moderna's likely to follow shortly — mrna vaccines could set a new industry standard.
how mrna vaccines train the body to fight the coronavirus
an infographic showing how mrna vaccines are developed. shayanne gal/insider
messenger rna is genetic material that tells cells how to make proteins. pfizer's coronavirus vaccine candidate works by injecting a small piece of coronavirus mrna into the body. that rna codes for the virus' spike protein, which is what helps it attach to and invade cells. that's also what antibodies target and neutralize.
advertisement

so the mrna vaccine spurs the body to produce the spike protein internally in order to trigger that same immune response.
moderna's candidate works in the same way and has been found to be 94.5% effective in trials.
utilizing mrna vaccine technology meant biontech and moderna only needed the coronavirus' genetic sequence to design a vaccine. that's why they could move forward so quickly.

on january 24, sahin read a paper in the lancet that described chinese family members who traveled to wuhan then contracted covid-19.

"what was most concerning is that one of the family members had the virus and was virus-positive but did not have symptoms," sahin told the journal. this meant that the virus could be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers — and had probably already spread out of china.
"the math behind it just showed me it will happen, it's just a matter of a few weeks," sahin said.
he decided to shift biontech's focus toward a coronavirus vaccine. the following week, sahin told the company that operations going forward would be devoted mostly to developing and testing the vaccine.
using the coronavirus' genetic sequence, which chinese researchers published on january 11, sahin designed 10 different candidates on his computer that weekend. one was the candidate later selected for larger trials — the one the fda has authorized.

sahin designed that winning candidate in just a few hours, according to the journal.
but biontech, with a pre-pandemic workforce of 1,000, didn't have the capacity to manufacture the hundreds of thousands of doses needed for large-scale trials — let alone the hundreds of millions it would need if the vaccine worked.
so in february, sahin called pfizer's head of vaccine research, kathrin jansen; biontech had worked with pfizer since 2018 on a flu vaccine.
"this is a disaster, and it's getting worse," dr. jansen told dr. sahin, according to the wall street journal. "happy to work with you."

the two companies announced their partnership in mid-march.

pfizer would manage the logistics, including manufacturing the vaccine in large batches and organizing the phase 3 trial, which wound up involving 43,500 volunteers. biontech, meanwhile, handled the vaccine's design.
pfizer and biontech announced that their vaccine was more than 90% effective on november 9. when pfizer ceo albert bourla told told senior company officials of the findings, people jumped up from their chairs, the wall street journal reported.
the full results of the phase 3 trial were even stronger: the findings, published in the new england journal of medicine on thursday, suggest that the vaccine doesn't trigger severe side effects in most people and is 95% effective at preventing covid-19.
advertisement
advertisement
anthony fauci, the nation's leading infectious-disease expert, called the results "just extraordinary" and said they would "have a major impact on everything that we do with regard to covid."
the speed at which biontech and pizer developed the vaccine does not mean they sacrificed thoroughness, according to albert rizzo, chief medical officer for the american lung association.
"we're not skipping steps — we actually have better technology," rizzo previously told business insider. "why did it take two weeks to cross the atlantic back in the 1800s? well, we had to go on a boat. whereas now, you can get across the ocean in several hours."
the pros and cons of mrna vaccines
for decades, vaccines contained a dead or weakened version of a virus itself. then early advances in genetics allowed vaccines to use proteins made by the virus instead. that method was first used in the 1980s to develop a vaccine for hepatitis b. companies like novavax are relying on the same protein-based model to create their coronavirus vaccine candidates.

but biontech was founded on the idea that mrna could be used to develop cancer vaccines, hence its mrna-based approach to the coronavirus. one of the company's senior vice presidents, biochemist katalin karikó, first discovered how to configure mrna to be used in vaccines.

since rna vaccines aren't cultivated using cells, they're quicker to produce.
the drawbacks of pfizer and biontech's vaccine, however, are that people must get two injections three weeks apart, and it needs to be shipped at about -94 degrees fahrenheit. that requires dry ice and special freezers.
crucial questions about the vaccine also remain, like how long it will protect people from covid-19 and whether it can prevent transmission and asymptomatic infection.

forty-seven members of congress are urging the pentagon to “immediately revoke” the covid-19 vaccine mandate issued last august for all service members, civilian personnel, and contractors.
the lawmakers also are asking to re-instate those who’ve already been discharged for noncompliance.
in a sept. 15 letter to defense secretary lloyd austin, the lawmakers wrote “to express our grave concern over the effect of the department of defense’s covid-19 vaccine mandate on the readiness of our armed forces, particularly the u.s. army.
“as a result of your mandate, eight percent of the army’s approximately 1 million soldiers face expulsion, army recruiters cannot meet their fy22 target, and the army has cut its projected fy23 end strength by 12,000 soldiers. as a major land war rages in europe, our own military faces a self-imposed readiness crisis.”
the letter was co-led by republican reps. mike johnson of louisiana, chip roy of texas and thomas massie of kentucky.
“the opaqueness of the department continues to frustrate members of congress attempting to perform oversight of the executive branch,” they write, adding, “our repeated inquiries remain unanswered.
“we are not the only ones frustrated. thousands of these service members have been left in limbo while they wait for the adjudication of religious and medical exemptions. some have waited for nearly a year to learn if they will be forcibly discharged for their sincerely held religious beliefs or medical concerns.”
they also asked if 75,000 soldiers are discharged how the army will replace them since by the “very end of the fiscal year, the army has only met 52% of its fy22 recruiting goal.”
they also point out serious problems with the army’s existing recruitment strategy.
“earlier this summer, the service began accepting enlistees without high school degrees or geds, offering $35,000 to any enlistee willing to go to basic training within 45 days, removing tattoo policies, and allowing soldiers to pick their first duty station,” they write. “we are not at war, but the army is reducing basic standards and offering enlistment incentives greater than or equal to those during the height of the war on terror – with poorer results.”
according to cdc data, over 40% of american men between the ages of 18 and 24 refuse to take the covid-19 vaccine. that number is over 50% in the south, a region where more than half of all those enlisting in the u.s. military live.
austin’s mandate, the members of congress argue, automatically “disqualifies more than forty percent of the army’s target demographic from service nationwide, and over half of the individuals in the most fertile recruiting grounds.”
austin maintains that the mandate is imperative for mission readiness and the department has steadfastly defended it in lawsuits filed against it. those representing the branches of the military sued have argued federal district judges don’t have jurisdiction to rule on military cases, which they’ve lost. they fought against federal judges granting class action status, which they also lost in cases in which judges issued stinging rebukes of military policies.
the members of congress argue, “increasing amounts of data raise legitimate questions” about the mandate. service members under 40 without comorbidities have nearly no chance of dying from the coronavirus, they argue, and “study after study has shown that covid vaccinations have negligible or even negative efficacy against the omicron strains. we also know that natural immunity provides better protection against infection and death than existing covid vaccines, yet the department still refuses to recognize it in lieu of vaccination.”
the legislators also requested information from austin about how many military members have been vaccinated, how many filed religious, medical and administrative exemption requests, and how many requests were granted. they also asked how much it will cost to recruit, train and find replacements for those facing expulsion.
they conclude, “the data is now clear. the department of defense’s covid vaccine mandate is deleterious to readiness and the military’s ability to fight and win wars. the vaccine provides negligible benefit to the young, fit members of our armed forces, and the mandate’s imposition is clearly affecting the department’s ability to sustain combat formations and recruit future talent. we urge you to immediately revoke your covid-19 vaccine mandate for all service members, civilian personnel, and contractors and re-instate those who have already been discharged.”
since august 24, 2021, the department “has unlawfully administered emergency use authorized products as if they were fully licensed fda approved products and military members have not been allowed to exercise their legal right to refuse them,” liberty counsel, which represents members of the u.s. military in lawsuits against the administration, argues.
it’s also reported examples of military members whose religious exemption requests have been denied and have faced “cruel and unusual punishment.”
its founder and chairman mat staver said, “it is indisputable that for one year the military has forced the shots when they knew they were under the emergency use authorization law and not fda approved. our military service members have been threatened and punished in violation of federal law. every member of congress should demand this covid shot mandate end immediately.”

defense officials won’t be allowed to give other-than-honorable discharges to troops who refuse covid-19 vaccines once the new defense authorization bill is signed into law.
but even before that, service leaders have opted for less confrontational dismissals as they are starting to process some of those individuals out of the ranks.
on thursday, marine corps leaders announced that 103 service members have been separated in recent weeks for refusing the vaccine, which was mandated for all troops by defense secretary lloyd austin earlier this summer.
earlier in the week, the air force announced it had booted 27 airmen for failing to meet the requirement.

punishment for failing to follow the orders could have included a dishonorable discharge designation, a move that would bar those individuals from eligibility for a host of veterans benefits, including gi bill assistance and veterans affairs home loans.
but maj. jim stenger, spokesman for the marine corps, said that in nearly all of the cases so far, individuals received dismissals with “general, under honorable conditions” designations. ann stefanek, chief of air force media operations, said that all of the discharged airmen were assigned status as honorable or general under honorable conditions.
“the department of the air force is following the intent laid out in the national defense authorization act,” she said.
the authorization bill, finalized by congress on wednesday, mandates that “any discharge of a servicemember on the sole basis that the member failed to obey a lawful order to receive a vaccine for covid-19 shall be an honorable discharge, or a general discharge under honorable conditions.”
the language was added to the bill by house lawmakers over the summer, shortly after the vaccine mandate was announced. while no pentagon leaders specified that they would be seeking severe punishment for the vaccine refusals, numerous conservative lawmakers tied the idea to their objections over the policy.
earlier this week, rep. mark green, r-tenn., and an army veteran, praised the inclusion of the idea in the final defense bill, calling it “a big leap in the right direction” for the military. he authored the original amendment on the issue during house debate over the authorization legislation.
“we must always stand for our brave men and women in uniform all around this world,” he said.

president joe biden is expected to sign the defense bill into law in the coming days, making the vaccine refusal restrictions law.
service officials will still be allowed to give dishonorable discharges to individuals who refuse the vaccine and commit other infractions, but will have to provide a broader justification for those moves.
army and navy officials said they have not officially processed out any service members due to vaccine refusal yet, but are expecting to do so starting next month.
deadlines for compliance with the vaccine mandates for active duty troops have passed for each of the four services. military leaders have said more than 95% of the active duty force have received the vaccine.

“trident order #12,” disqualified seals seeking religious exemptions from the covid-19 vaccine. seals seeking the exemption would be barred from training, traveling for deployment and conducting other standard business thus making them un-deployable.
the gateway pundit has reported extensively on the negative impact that vaccine mandates have had on the us military as well as the concerning use of the mandate to “intentionally purge” religious military members.
a recent tgp article detailed the grim details of the vaccine injuries faced by those in the military that were forced to receive it.
in august, jim hoft interviewed lt. john bowes on the fight against the mandate as well as the impact of the requirement on military readiness.
lt. bowes shared, “yes, absolutely. and let’s dig into that for a second and talk about just pilots i think are a good example of the national security issue that we face. right now we’re looking at a shortage of about 1900 pilots in the air force alone. and in 2017, the chief of staff of the air force said a shortage of 1500 pilots was a crisis, and we’ve grown that number by 400 now. and so to say that we are in a pilot crisis in terms of retention and manning and then to also discharge these pilots doesn’t seem to work out with our national security goals, especially in a time where intentions with russia and china are rising almost daily.”
in march, the biden administration asked the u.s. supreme court to reinforce its covid-19 vaccine mandate to groups of navy seals who remain unvaccinated, dishonestly claiming it “poses intolerable risks to safety and mission success.”
the pentagon asked the supreme court to intervene after judge reed o’connor granted a temporary injunction to a group of navy seals from taking the biden covid vaccine mandate based on their requested religious exemptions.
“trident order #12” has now been quietly canceled by the us navy.
zero hedge reports:
the us navy quietly rolled back trident order #12, an order denying religious exemptions for covid vaccinations, a few months after an injunction was issued by the fifth circuit court of appeals in early 2022 as part of an ongoing lawsuit brought by first liberty institute. the suit was initiated on behalf of 35 active-duty seals and three reservists seeking exemptions to the mandate due to the possibility of covid vaccines being developed using cells and tissues from aborted fetuses. this information has only become publicly available after a new filing in the case this week. trident order #12 made any non-compliant seals and other troops impossible to deploy and designated them as medically disqualified. this development runs in tandem with a growing trend among government institutions; they back away from their original draconian mandates but in a manner that reduces media exposure and avoids any admission that the mandates are unconstitutional. a communication order was circulated by the navy on may 23 with the subject: “nswc closeout to trident order #12 – mandatory vaccination for covid-19.” nswc refers to the naval special warfare command: “this order rescinds reference a,” it states, referring to “ref a” as “trident order #12 on covid-19 vaccinations.” the may 23 communication order also said navy commands “will continue to follow guidance, as appropriate, regarding covid-19 vaccination, accommodation requests, and mitigation measures.”
the decision comes as every branch of the us military struggles to meet 2022 recruiting goals.

https://reason.com/volokh/2022/02/03/federal-court-temporarily-blocks-discipline-of-military-officers-for-religious-refusal-of-covid-vaccine/
from yesterday's decision by judge steven merryday (m.d. fla.) in navy seal 1 v. biden, following up on an earlier decision:
on january 20, 2022, the plaintiffs moved to amend the complaint. on january 21, 2022, the plaintiffs—in accord with the november 22 order—submit[ted] a supplemental memorandum in support of a preliminary injunction…. at 6:18 p.m. on february 1, 2022, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order on behalf of two service members allegedly confronting imminent removal from a position of command….
[my] november 22, 2021 order denies a preliminary injunction for the non-service members, defers resolving the motion on behalf of the service members, and requires the defendants to submit on january 7, 2022, a notice containing for each branch of the armed forces information about, among other things, the number of pending requests for religious and other exemptions and the number of requests denied after final appeal….
harboring a religious objection to the covid-19 vaccine, service members of each branch of the military, federal employees, federal contractors, and employees of federal contractors, sued on behalf of a putative class and promptly moved to temporarily restrain and to preliminarily enjoin military directives and executive orders requiring covid-19 vaccination but allowing requests for religious and other exemptions…. an october 18, 2021 scheduling order (doc. 9) observes that a temporary restraining order directed to the putative class will likely not issue, but the october 18 order states that the plaintiffs may move on behalf of an individual service member subject to a circumstance markedly more acute than the other members of the putative class….
navy commander serves as the commanding officer of a guided missile destroyer in the navy. navy commander joined the navy in 2004 and has served for more than seventeen years…. on january 28, 2022, the chief of naval operations, the ultimate appellate authority within the navy, denied navy commander's appeal [of the rejection of a religious exemption].
the appellate denial letter assumes that navy commander's "religious beliefs are sincere and would be substantially burdened." however, the letter states, among other things, that "[a] waiver of immunizations would have a predictable and detrimental effect on the readiness of you and the sailors who serve along side you" and that the other preventative measures, which for the last two years navy commander has required of the sailors under his command, "are not 100 percent effective and must be implemented in conjunction with immunization to reduce the risk of mission failure." the letter declines to mention that the navy has granted 270 medical exemptions and fails to explain the unsuitability of the alternative precautions afforded the recipients of a medical exemption….
lieutenant colonel 2 serves as a logistics officer at marine forces special operations command at camp lejeune, north carolina. lieutenant colonel enlisted in the marine corps in 1997…. before joining the military, lieutenant colonel 2 received an abortion after becoming pregnant from rape. this experience caused lieutenant colonel 2 to develop strong religious opposition to abortion and to any vaccine developed with fetal cell lines. in the denial letter [as to lieutenant colonel 2's appeal of the denial of her religious exemption], … the assistant commandant questions whether receiving the covid-19 vaccine substantially burdens a religious belief because lieutenant colonel 2's objections to the covid-19 vaccine "could be made for every fda approved vaccine [she has] received" in the military. further, "assuming that covid-19 vaccination substantially burdens" a religious belief, the assistant commandant concludes that "the government's compelling interests in military readiness and in the health and safety of the force" justifies denying lieutenant colonel 2's request. the denial letter declines to mention that the marines have granted 234 medical exemptions and fails to explain the unsuitability of the alternative precautions afforded a recipient of a medical exemption….
the order deferring the motion for a preliminary injunction contemplated that some exigent circumstance might require more narrow and interim relief to preserve, pending the outcome of pending matters, the rights of a service member otherwise subject to some adverse action by the military because of the military's denying, allegedly in violation of rfra, a service member's request for a religious exemption….
the record as a whole in this action and the attendant circumstances support the motion by the two service member plaintiffs, and the motion is granted-in-part for the following reasons and to the following extent. the purpose of this relief is preservation of the status quo for a week to permit a reasonable and practical opportunity for a hearing and any necessary and additional submissions from the parties. the hearing on further preliminary relief as a result of the pending motion will occur on february 10, 2022 ….
the record in this action establishes that the two service members are very likely to prevail on their claim that their respective branch of the military has wrongfully denied a religious exemption from covid-19 vaccination. the record creates a strong inference that the services are discriminatorily and systematically denying religious exemptions without a meaningful and fair hearing and without the showing required under rfra (while simultaneously granting medical exemptions and permitting unvaccinated persons to continue in service without adverse consequence).
one struggles to imagine a wholesome and lawful explanation for the results evidenced in this record. the military is well aware of the frailty of their arguments in defense of their practices. those arguments both procedural and substantive, are rejected in an action that is distinctively parallel to this action. u.s. navy seals 1–26, et
al v. biden (n.d. tex. jan. 3, 2022) (characterizing the military's review of requests for a religious exemption as "theater" and granting relief to the service member plaintiffs). rejection on the same or a more encompassing basis is likely in this action (especially if the conduct of the military continues along the present lines).
the two moving service members face either (1) a most-likely-unlawful deprivation of their accumulated status and standing in the united states military, as well as prospective advancement and benefits, or (2) deprivation of their constitutional and statutory rights to free exercise and the statutory right to receive a religious exemption unless the military can meet the statutory burden of proof, which the military has not and likely cannot. on the other hand, the military faces a trivial, if any, prospect of material injury as a result of permitting the service members continued service under the same terms and conditions and with the same privileges and emoluments as currently prevail, especially because the military permits a large group of unvaccinated persons to serve without adverse consequence.
finally, the military is most likely unable to establish, and certainly has not established, that permitting the relatively small number of rfra objectors, even if every request for exemption (much less the two at issue in this motion) were sincere and successful, to serve without adverse consequences to their standing and the terms and conditions of their service will adversely affect the public's interest in the maintenance and readiness of the nation's military forces. in fact, the public undoubtedly has some considerable interest in maintaining the services of skilled, experienced, highly trained, patriotic, courageous, and esteemed service members, such as the two moving service members, in whom the public has an immense financial investment and who are not, to say the least, readily replaceable.
the secretary of defense and anyone acting in concert with him, as specified in and to the full extent of rule 65, federal rules of civil procedure, is enjoined through february 11, 2022, from diminishing or altering in any manner and for any reason the current status of navy commander and lieutenant colonel 2, including their assignment, privileges, rank, or the like. in short, navy commander and lieutenant colonel 2 must remain "as is" throughout the duration of this injunctive relief….

https://en-volve.com/2022/03/30/military-doctor-testifies-under-oath-that-she-was-ordered-to-cover-up-vaccine-injuries-through-biden-admin-directive/
dr. theresa long, a us military medical officer, stated in court that she was told by a superior to conceal covid-19 vaccination injuries as part of the biden administration’s directive.
the department of defense dismissed dr. long’s findings, claiming that the spike in vaccination injuries was due to a “database malfunction.”
liberty counsel, the law firm representing thirty members of the military who are fighting the military vaccine mandate, returned to federal court on march 10 to defend the preliminary injunction granted to two military plaintiffs by judge steven merryday, allowing them to avoid the military vaccine mandate.
while the case was on appeal, the department of defense (dod) petitioned the judge to set aside the injunction.
judge merryday is a united states district judge for the middle district of florida of the united states district court.
per dailyexpose: during the all-day hearing, liberty counsel presented compelling testimony from the navy commander of a surface warship and three military flight surgeons, lt. col. peter chambers, lt. col. teresa long and col. (ret.) stewart tankersley, m.d. in contrast, the dod declined to present witnesses.
founder and chairman of liberty counsel mat staver said in an interview with the blaze’s daniel horowitz on monday that there have been three hearings now in this case, and the dod has not yet offered a single witness. instead of witnesses, the government “sends these declarations,” staver explained. he said the judge has urged them to bring live witnesses to court so they can be cross examined, but they just refuse to do it. “so they send these declarations that some jag attorney writes, and somebody in the military signs off on them.”
staver said that the information the dod has been presenting in court is “outdated, wrong, and would really be subject to dismantling under cross examination.” he added that cross examinations of his witnesses have only made their case stronger. “so they really don’t have anything to cross examine our witnesses with,” he said.
staver told horowitz that judge merryday has chastised the dod lawyers during the hearings, telling them they have “a frail case,” and are “acting as though they are above the law.”
dr. theresa long, a flight surgeon who holds a master’s degree in public health and is specially trained in the dmed, gave emotional testimony on march 10.
she and two other flight surgeons reviewed dmed last year and made some stunning discoveries about the high incidence of apparent vaccine injuries among members of the military.
according to the whistleblowers, certain disorders spiked after the vaccine mandate went into effect, including miscarriages and cancers, and neurological problems which increased by 1000 percent.
dr. long testified that she was contacted by high level officer the night before the hearing, and told not to discuss her findings regarding the explosive military medical data in court. the whistleblower reportedly said she felt threatened after she tried to get her superiors to address the findings, “fearing for her life and for the safety of her children.”
since the whistleblowers came forward with the dmed data, the dod has thrown cold water on their conclusions, saying the increase in vaccine injuries was caused by a “glitch in the database.”
politifact contacted peter graves, spokesperson for the defense health agency’s armed forces surveillance division, who said the data for 2021 is correct, but for some reason, the data for the five years prior was inaccurate. graves told politifact by email that the division reviewed data in the dmed “and found that the data was incorrect for the years 2016-2020.”
in other words, for five straight years, the data was seriously corrupted and none of the dod’s data analysts figured this out, and then it fixed itself on its own in 2021. the dod has since put out new numbers showing more illnesses among the troops for the years prior to 2021.
staver asked long a question about the dmed data during the hearing, and she answered: “i have been ordered not to answer that question.”
judge merryday reportedly asked long: “ordered by who?,” and the doctor explained what happened the night before the hearing.
staver then asked long if the information the military ordered her to withhold was relevant and helpful for the court and the public to know. she said, “yes,” and staver asked her why.
long reportedly paused and choked back tears as she told the judge: “i have so many soldiers being destroyed by this vaccine. not a single member of my senior command has discussed my concerns with me … i have nothing to gain and everything to lose by talking about it. i’m ok with that because i am watching people get absolutely destroyed.”
dr. long also testified that the data shows that deaths of military members from the vaccines exceed deaths from covid itself.
staver later told horowitz that the dod’s order for her not to discuss dmed amounted to witness tampering, especially since long has whistleblower protections.
“they not only violated the whistleblower act, they potentially intimidated a witness and tried to change that witness’ testimony,” he said during the conservative review podcast on monday.
the doctor said she is constantly contacted by people who have been injured by the genetic vaccines, and that many of those injured are pilots, who are expected to meet high fitness standards. long told staver that in just one afternoon she heard from four pilots who had just gotten mris back showing that they had myocarditis.
morale is tanking in the military, she testified, with soldiers are in despair over the pressure to get the vaccine, and some are even having suicidal thoughts.
long said she was aware of at least two people who have committed suicide over the pressure, and the threat of punishment for refusal.
she said the current regime’s policies are undermining “good order and discipline.”
in addition to dr. long, an unnamed navy commander testified about his commander’s attempts to punish him for refusing the experimental injections.
on february 2, judge merryday issued a temporary restraining order blocking the navy from punishing the commander because of his vaccination status. judge merryday ruled the navy violated the federal religious freedom restoration act (rfra).
when the court ordered the commodore to comply with the law, he filed an affidavit saying he had “lost confidence” in the commander because the commander had not taken the covid shots.
the judge then entered a preliminary injunction, and the dod and the navy filed a motion asking the court to set aside his injunction, arguing that due to their “lost confidence” in the commander, his ship could not deploy.
however, at the time the ship was allegedly unable to be deployed, the commander was actually far out to sea testing the ship and training the crew.
while many commanders fail to complete these operations timely, the commander completed the mission early and the ship deemed “safe and ready.”
in a dramatic moment, the commander said he should not have to be there in court defending religious freedom. “generals and admirals should be here saying what i am saying today to uphold religious freedom. our religious freedoms are being attacked.”
also testifying last week was dr. pete chambers, a purple heart recipient who is in the texas national guard defending the southern border where 10,000-20,000 illegal immigrants are flooding through every week. “my job is to keep our soldiers safe,” chambers said.
chambers was hoping to retire from the military in 2023 after nearly 40 years of service, but his adverse reaction to the moderna shot derailed his plans.
trusting the military that the shots are “safe and effective,” and not knowing at the time that aborted fetal cells were used in the testing and/or development, he took the shot. he now suffers from demyelination, a condition affecting the central nervous system caused by the injection.
after his moderna injury, dr. chambers met lt. col. long. they reviewed the dod’s defense medical epidemiology database (dmed), the military equivalent to the federal government’s vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers), where he discovered other military members also developed a demyelination disease after the covid shots.
chambers, a military flight surgeon and one of only six green beret surgeons, was told that his job was to get soldiers to vaccinated. his superiors told him that religious exemptions would be automatically denied. “soldiers will try. soldiers will fail,” this commanders said.
he pointed out that shots are not effective in preventing infection, and estimated that about 75-80% of soldiers getting infected are “double vaxxed” compared to only about 15% of soldiers who are not vaccinated.
like long, chambers also testified that many soldiers are being injured by the covid shots, and that “this is not normal.”
dr. stewart tankersley, a flight surgeon who retired in september 2021 at the rank of colonel, testified that the injections are neither safe nor effective.
tankersley said he has personally treated over 200 covid patients with no fatalities, and the group of doctors with whom he is associated has treated over 18,000 covid patients with deaths only in the single digits.
“i’ve never seen anything like this in the military or civilian world, the lack of dialogue, the suppression of scientific dialogue.” tankersley said on the stand.
dr. tankersley explained one of several reasons there are so many injuries from the covid shots. the mrna vaccines require a lipid nanoparticle (lnp) as a delivery mechanism because the rna quickly degrades without being encased in the lnp. the combination bypasses the natural immune system and creates inflammation that can inhibit the body’s innate immunity.
dr. tankersley testified that the shots are neither safe nor effective. he also testified that there are safe and effective treatments for covid, including nasal rinsing and ivermectin.
liberty counsel argued that the dod’s position that the only one way to combat covid and ensure military readiness is to force the injections and kick out the unvaccinated is “untenable,” and that the mandate is undermining military readiness and harming morale.
staver said: “i am honored to serve the brave men and women of the military. i am dismayed by the abuse and propaganda forced upon them from the white house and the department of defense. the truth will prevail, and freedom will win.”

https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/12/02/politics/florida-state-guard-desantis/index.html
st, petersburg, florida (cnn) florida gov. ron desantis wants to reestablish a world war ii-era civilian military force that he, not the pentagon, would control.
desantis pitched the idea thursday as a way to further support the florida national guard during emergencies, like hurricanes. the florida national guard has also played a vital role during the pandemic in administering covid-19 tests and distributing vaccines.
but in a nod to the growing tension between republican states and the biden administration over the national guard, desantis also said this unit, called the florida state guard, would be "not encumbered by the federal government." he said this force would give him "the flexibility and the ability needed to respond to events in our state in the most effective way possible." desantis is proposing bringing it back with a volunteer force of 200 civilians, and he is seeking $3.5 million from the state legislature in startup costs to train and equip them.

states have the power to create defense forces separate from the national guard, though not all of them use it. if florida moves ahead with desantis' plan to reestablish the civilian force, it would become the 23rd active state guard in the country, desantis' office said in a press release, joining california, texas and new york. these guards are little-known auxiliary forces with origins dating back to the advent of state militias in the 18th century. while states and the department of defense share control of the national guard, state guards are solely in the power of a governor.
the proposal from desantis comes on the heels of defense secretary lloyd austin's directive warning that national guard members who refuse to get vaccinated against the coronavirus will have their pay withheld and barred from training. oklahoma gov. kevin stitt, a republican, had requested an exemption for guard members in his state, which austin denied.
democrats in florida immediately expressed alarm at desantis' announcement. us rep. charlie crist, who is running as a democrat to challenge the governor in 2022, tweeted, "no governor should have his own handpicked secret police."
state sen. annette taddeo, another gubernatorial candidate, wrote on twitter that desantis was a "wannabe dictator trying to make his move for his own vigilante militia like we've seen in cuba."
the florida state guard was created in 1941 during world war ii as a temporary force to fill the void left behind when the florida national guard was deployed to assist in the us combat efforts. it was disbanded after the war ended, but the authority for a governor to establish a state defense force remained.
"reestablishing the florida state guard will allow civilians from all over the state to be trained in the best emergency response techniques and have the ability to mobilize very, very quickly," desantis said during a visit to pensacola on thursday.
state guards are typically deployed to respond during a disaster, though governors have found other reasons to call them into action.
in 2015, republican gov. greg abbott used the texas state guard to monitor federal military exercises in his state, responding to what was at the time a fast-growing conspiracy theory that the federal government was using walmart parking lots to prepare for a future state of martial law. abbott said the guards were just collecting information to keep texans safe during the multi-week exercises.
florida law authorizes the governor to maintain a defense force as "necessary to assist the civil authorities in maintaining law and order," meaning desantis would have another force to respond to unrest that may erupt in the future. desantis swiftly deployed the florida national guard to major cities after protests and violence broke out in response to the murder of george floyd in minnesota.
desantis has also stationed florida national guard troops at the texas-mexico border and sent them to washington, dc, to help protect the us capitol during the inauguration of president joe biden.
the announcement on thursday came during a broader rollout of desantis' plan to bolster florida's national guard, which included $100 million in funding proposals to establish three new armories, build a new headquarters for the national guard counter drug program and provide support for florida national guardsmen seeking higher-education degrees.

three united states military doctors have blown the whistle on documents allegedly from the united states department of defense (dod) that they had access to, which show “skyrocketing rates of disease” since the introduction and mandating of the ccp virus vaccines in armed forces, human rights attorney leigh dundas told the epoch times.
dundas was recently approached by dr. samuel sigoloff, special forces flight surgeon lt. col. peter chambers, and aerospace occupational medicine specialist lt. col. theresa long.
they handed documents to dundas, who appeared recently with attorney tom renz in a five-hour hearing organized by sen. ron johnson (r-wis.) titled “covid-19: second opinion.”
renz shared some of the numbers related to medical disorders in the u.s. military data with the epoch times.
the whistleblowers, who are represented by renz, gave him the data “under penalty of perjury,” he said during the hearing.
renz intends to submit the information to the courts, he told johnson.
the dod responded that the dmed (defense medical epidemiology database) data from 2016 to 2020 that the whistleblowers brought up was erroneous and incomplete, and is currently under review.
“dha’s armed forces surveillance division (afsd) conducted a complete review of the data contained in the defense medical epidemiology database (dmed) and found that the data was incorrect for the years 2016-2020,” maj. charlie dietz, a spokesperson for the dod, told the epoch times.
“dmed is a web-based tool to query de-identified active component personnel and medical event data contained within the defense medical surveillance system (dmss).
“comparing the dmed database to the source data contained in dmss, afhsd discovered that the total number of medical diagnoses from 2016-2020 that were accessible in dmed represented only a small fraction of actual medical diagnoses for those years. in contrast, the 2021 total number of medical diagnoses were up to date in dmed. comparison of 2021 to 2016-2020 resulted in the appearance of significant increased occurrence of all medical diagnoses in 2021 because of the under-reported data for 2016-2020. afhsd has taken dmed offline to identify and correct the root-cause of the data corruption,” dietz said.
renz responded:
“the dod has claimed that the dmed data from the years 2016-2020 was incorrect. this is absurd. we spend millions of dollars per year on dmed and people monitoring dmed which is one of the premier epidemiological databases in the world. accuracy in this database is critical as it is used to monitor for health issues in our troops.
“the dod would have us believe that the dmed database was wrong from 2016-2020 but then magically was corrected in 2021 despite the fact that they had not noticed it was wrong until we pointed it out in our testimony before senator johnson. further, we are asked to believe that in 2020, the year of what they claim to be the greatest pandemic since 1918, and despite the fact that it is documented that the cdc was also watching this database, no one noticed an error of 20 million-plus injury/disease codes per year,” renz told the epoch times.
“the department of defense, the biden administration is on notice they must preserve these records and this must be investigated,” johnson said in the five-hour hearing in washington.
“renz also informed me that some dmed data showing registered diagnoses of myocarditis had been removed from the database. following the allegation that dmed data had been doctored, i immediately wrote to you on january 24 requesting that you preserve all records referring, relating, or reported to dmed. i have yet to hear whether you have complied with this request.” johnson wrote in a letter (pdf) to lloyd austin, the u.s. defense secretary.
medical data
dundas told the epoch times that “in january of 2021. they introduced the vaccine, they mandated the vaccine for the u.s. military members. and in just the first 10 months of that vaccination year, anxiety jumped from 37,000 typically prior to that to 931,791 cases. it was a 2,400 plus percent increase.”
she went on to say that breast cancer was “pretty formulaic,” ranging from 500 to 900 cases for the five years prior to the introduction of the mandatory vaccination.
“first 10 months or 2021. they were at 4,068 cases. again, it was about 450 some odd percent increase.
“female infertility 2,200 cases a year a bad year would be 2,300 cases a year, first 10 months of 2021 after the vaccine 10,713 cases. ”
even diseases that have not been connected so far with the vaccines saw a dramatic spike.
“esophageal cancer in the u.s. military. very, very minimal. twenty-five, 26 cases, maybe a bad year is 39 cases. jumps to 200 plus cases,” dundas said.
“january acute myocarditis was in 176 cases, but now it’s practically down to 70 … bad that stuff going on,” she continued.
“bell’s palsy 400 cases a year on average in the first 10 months of 2021 over 1,300 cases.”
“cognitive issues way up altered mental status way up. congenital male malformations doubled.”
“hiv 400 cases on average [per year] and now over 2,400 cases in the first 10 months.”
miscarriages
according to the whistleblower documents, miscarriages in the military were at 1,400 to 1,500 a year in the first three quarters of 2020, and it increased to over 4,000 during the first 10 months of 2021.
the epoch times reached out to dr. christiane northrup, a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist with more than 30 years of experience and the former president of the american holistic medical association.
particularly alarming is the increase in miscarriages, she said.
“here’s what we were finding—starting in april of 2021. all of us in the five doc’s group, dr. lee merritt, dr. carrie madej, dr. sherri tenpenny, and dr. larry palevsky, and me. we were hearing stories from all over the country about women who were having abnormal bleeding, miscarriages, and stillbirths, just from being around the people who had recently had the shot,” northrup told the epoch times.
“we all got together and we said, wait a minute. we’ve got to study this,” northrup went on.
“people that i knew in the fertility business, we’re finding that all these women were having problems. i was getting a lot of personal calls. ‘what do i do?’ … we were very concerned.”
michael yeadon, the former pfizer vice president and chief scientist for allergy and respiratory research, and dr. wolfgang wodarg issued a petition (pdf) for administrative action regarding confirmation of efficacy on several of their findings regarding the ccp (chinese communist party) virus vaccines.
“we detailed a series of mechanistic toxicology concerns which we believed were reasonable to hold, unless & until proven not to occur,” yeadon told the epoch times.
“among those was that adverse impacts on conception & ability to sustain a pregnancy were foreseeable,” he added.
“it’s important to note that none of these gene-based agents had completed what’s called ‘reproductive toxicology.’ over a year later, this battery of tests in animals still has not been done. so there was & still is no data package supporting safety in pregnancy or prior to conception.”
one of the whistleblowers, dr. pete constantine chambers, has been practicing medicine for 25 years, 16 of which he served as a flight surgeon attached to special operations.
“here is a question that troubles me,” chambers told the epoch times via email.
“after having my orders cut short leaving me no medical insurance coverage, losing my pay and leave that i had accumulated without any forewarning for exhibiting the army value of personal courage, and practicing the safe standard of care medicine by an entity i have served for so long; 1) what will happen to my enlisted troops? 2) how many? how many soldiers and airmen will experience adverse reactions, some of which result in disabilities or god forbid, death.
“one might call a provider such as myself an ‘anti-vaxxer.’ nothing is further from the truth,” he further noted.
“i took the full course starting in january. i trusted my government and medical leaders. i have taken every vaccine the army has given me since my first day as a private, in 1983. however, i too have experienced adverse reactions and am currently in the care of medical specialists exploring the signs and symptoms post second vaccine as well as the ominous finding on my brain mri.
“i love my country, my state, and the heroes i work with and for. i believe all americans are worth the sacrifices we make to keep us safe. i also believe as a provider in the first stanza of the hippocratic oath; ‘first of all, do no harm.’”

https://www.theepochtimes.com/exclusive-pentagon-responds-to-dod-whistleblowers-claim-of-spiking-disease-rates-in-the-military-after-covid-vaccine-mandate_4247785.html?utm_source=ref_share&utm_campaign=tw&rs=SHRPSMRQ
three united states military doctors have blown the whistle on documents allegedly from the united states department of defense (dod) that they had access to, which show "skyrocketing rates of disease" since the introduction and mandating of the ccp virus vaccines in armed forces, human rights attorney leigh dundas told the epoch times.
dundas was recently approached by dr. samuel sigoloff, special forces flight surgeon lt. col. peter chambers, and aerospace occupational medicine specialist lt. col. theresa long.
they handed documents to dundas, who appeared recently with attorney tom renz in a five-hour hearing organized by sen. ron johnson (r-wis.) titled "covid-19: second opinion."
renz shared some of the numbers related to medical disorders in the u.s. military data with the epoch times.
the whistleblowers, who are represented by renz, gave him the data "under penalty of perjury," he said during the hearing.
renz intends to submit the information to the courts, he told johnson.
the dod responded that the dmed (defense medical epidemiology database) data from 2016 to 2020 that the whistleblowers brought up was erroneous and incomplete, and is currently under review.
"dha’s armed forces surveillance division (afsd) conducted a complete review of the data contained in the defense medical epidemiology database (dmed) and found that the data was incorrect for the years 2016-2020," maj. charlie dietz, a spokesperson for the dod, told the epoch times.
"dmed is a web-based tool to query de-identified active component personnel and medical event data contained within the defense medical surveillance system (dmss).
"comparing the dmed database to the source data contained in dmss, afhsd discovered that the total number of medical diagnoses from 2016-2020 that were accessible in dmed represented only a small fraction of actual medical diagnoses for those years. in contrast, the 2021 total number of medical diagnoses were up to date in dmed. comparison of 2021 to 2016-2020 resulted in the appearance of significant increased occurrence of all medical diagnoses in 2021 because of the under-reported data for 2016-2020. afhsd has taken dmed offline to identify and correct the root-cause of the data corruption," dietz said.
renz responded: "the dod has claimed that the dmed data from the years 2016-2020 was incorrect. this is absurd. we spend millions of dollars per year on dmed and people monitoring dmed which is one of the premier epidemiological databases in the world. accuracy in this database is critical as it is used to monitor for health issues in our troops.
"the dod would have us believe that the dmed database was wrong from 2016-2020 but then magically was corrected in 2021 despite the fact that they had not noticed it was wrong until we pointed it out in our testimony before senator johnson. further, we are asked to believe that in 2020, the year of what they claim to be the greatest pandemic since 1918, and despite the fact that it is documented that the cdc was also watching this database, no one noticed an error of 20 million-plus injury/disease codes per year," renz told the epoch times.
“the department of defense, the biden administration is on notice they must preserve these records and this must be investigated,” johnson said in the five-hour hearing in washington.
"renz also informed me that some dmed data showing registered diagnoses of myocarditis had been removed from the database. following the allegation that dmed data had been doctored, i immediately wrote to you on january 24 requesting that you preserve all records referring, relating, or reported to dmed. i have yet to hear whether you have complied with this request." johnson wrote in a letter (pdf) to lloyd austin, the u.s. defense secretary.
medical data
dundas told the epoch times that "in january of 2021. they introduced the vaccine, they mandated the vaccine for the u.s. military members. and in just the first 10 months of that vaccination year, anxiety jumped from 37,000 typically prior to that to 931,791 cases. it was a 2,400 plus percent increase."
she went on to say that breast cancer was "pretty formulaic," ranging from 500 to 900 cases for the five years prior to the introduction of the mandatory vaccination.
"first 10 months or 2021. they were at 4,068 cases. again, it was about 450 some odd percent increase.
"female infertility 2,200 cases a year a bad year would be 2,300 cases a year, first 10 months of 2021 after the vaccine 10,713 cases. "
even diseases that have not been connected so far with the vaccines saw a dramatic spike.
"esophageal cancer in the u.s. military. very, very minimal. twenty-five, 26 cases, maybe a bad year is 39 cases. jumps to 200 plus cases," dundas said.
"january acute myocarditis was in 176 cases, but now it's practically down to 70 ... bad that stuff going on," she continued.
"bell's palsy 400 cases a year on average in the first 10 months of 2021 over 1,300 cases. cognitive issues way up altered mental status way up. congenital male malformations doubled.
"hiv 400 cases on average [per year] and now over 2,400 cases in the first 10 months."
miscarriages
according to the whistleblower documents, miscarriages in the military were at 1,400 to 1,500 a year in the first three quarters of 2020, and it increased to over 4,000 during the first 10 months of 2021.
the epoch times reached out to dr. christiane northrup, a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist with more than 30 years of experience and the former president of the american holistic medical association.
particularly alarming is the increase in miscarriages, she said.
"here's what we were finding—starting in april of 2021. all of us in the five doc's group, dr. lee merritt, dr. carrie madej, dr. sherri tenpenny, and dr. larry palevsky, and me. we were hearing stories from all over the country about women who were having abnormal bleeding, miscarriages, and stillbirths, just from being around the people who had recently had the shot," northrup told the epoch times.
"we all got together and we said, wait a minute. we've got to study this," northrup went on.
"people that i knew in the fertility business, we're finding that all these women were having problems. i was getting a lot of personal calls. 'what do i do?' ... we were very concerned."
michael yeadon, the former pfizer vice president and chief scientist for allergy and respiratory research, and dr. wolfgang wodarg issued a petition (pdf) for administrative action regarding confirmation of efficacy on several of their findings regarding the ccp (chinese communist party) virus vaccines.
"we detailed a series of mechanistic toxicology concerns which we believed were reasonable to hold, unless & until proven not to occur," yeadon told the epoch times.
"among those was that adverse impacts on conception & ability to sustain a pregnancy were foreseeable," he added.
"it’s important to note that none of these gene-based agents had completed what’s called 'reproductive toxicology.' over a year later, this battery of tests in animals still has not been done. so there was & still is no data package supporting safety in pregnancy or prior to conception."
one of the whistleblowers, dr. pete constantine chambers, has been practicing medicine for 25 years, 16 of which he served as a flight surgeon attached to special operations.
"here is a question that troubles me," chambers told the epoch times via email.

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/canada-anti-vaccine-trucker-protests/622060/
recently i published a book of speculative nonfiction about the possibility of a civil war in the united states. in the opening chapter, i imagine a scenario in which a carnivalesque group of far-right activists takes over a bridge and refuses to leave, provoking a response from federal authorities. my fantasy became reality recently, except not in a rural american county, as i had envisioned it, but in windsor, ontario. for five years, i have been studying american political rage, its sources, its abyssal depths, its vertiginous fracturing power. i thought i was studying an external phenomenon at a distance, and i was. now the rage has come for me. the anti-vax trucker convoy has made it up close and personal.
three weeks ago, truckers formed a convoy to protest the cross-border covid-vaccine mandate. last weekend, they rolled into my toronto neighborhood, near bloor street and avenue road. i went down to bear witness to the spectacle. the scene was not surprising to me: the same sort of people i’d seen at donald trump rallies and prepper conventions were there, with their hollowed-out faces intimate with pain, and their perpetually misspelled signs, and their sense of belonging to a community of the excluded. i confess that they disgusted me. i found myself stopping several people on the street and telling them to go home, that they weren’t wanted here.
david frum: trucker blockades in canada may just be the beginning
the truckers want “freedom” from mandates and have called for prime minister justin trudeau to resign. they won’t achieve either of these goals, so what they’re doing now amounts to disruption for disruption’s sake. trucks have been driving around the entrances to the ottawa airport in a kind of slow-motion blockade. this is a deliberate tactic to force the federal government to take action. the protesters want confrontation with trudeau, not doug ford, the conservative premier of ontario, because only such a confrontation could save their movement. their forces are diminishing: about 1,000 people are left in the ottawa convoy, although that number may rise over the weekend. their main avenue of fundraising has been suspended; a week after gofundme stopped all trucker fundraising activities, the conservative government of ontario froze all givesendgo donations. the federal government has, so far, resisted the impulse to call in the military, and it is quite right to do so. every day the truckers remain in ottawa, they appall a larger and larger segment of the canadian population. “never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake,” as napoleon said. time is firmly on the authorities’ side, if not that of the people suffering in ottawa.
ultimately, i know that this trucker convoy will come to nothing. its power has been exaggerated by u.s. media, principally fox news. nearly 60 percent of canadians find the protesters “offensive and inappropriate.” more to the point, 88 percent of people in canada over the age of 4 have been vaccinated, including 85 percent of those in the trucking profession. the main trucking advocacy groups are on board with the vaccine mandate, as are the teamsters. at their peak, the trucker protests had just 8,000 people. the conservative party of canada has told the truckers to go home; they have virtually no mainstream political support, except from a few remote members of parliament from saskatchewan. nobody sensible can feel threatened by anything that comes out of saskatchewan.
direct military confrontation with the convoy would be the worst strategy; after all, nearly a quarter of the protesters have their kids with them. most likely the government will resolve to prosecute everyone involved in planning the convoy and investigate all foreign sources of support. the truckers have made life hell for their fellow citizens and threatened the democratic process, impotently but intentionally. custodial sentences, massive fines, and class-action lawsuits are all coming. these situations never end well for the hostage-takers.
on some level, though, even that kind of reaction seems over-the-top to me. these protests have been peaceful. i think that if you want to see accelerationist or insurgent tendencies, you have to squint. everyone i have spoken with who has actually been to these rallies has described them to me as a tailgate. several sources reported nazi-flag sightings, but the nazi flags in question were accusing trudeau of being a nazi. i guess it’s a small comfort that, for the trucker convoy in ottawa, the nazis are still the bad guys, unlike for, say, the “jews will not replace us” crowd in charlottesville, virginia. the rally in my neighborhood took place at the corner where the royal ontario museum happens to be. during the rally, the museum didn’t even close. i’m sure the trucks looked impressive on twitter, if you angled the phone just right to make them look dangerous, but there, in person, kids were strolling by on their way to look at dinosaurs. january 6, it wasn’t.
read: trump’s next coup has already begun
the truckers matter principally as an example of an american political proxy conflict spilling over our border, and as a harbinger of more such conflicts. peter sloly, the ottawa police chief, has declared that a “sizable element” from the u.s. has been involved in fundraising and organizing. the ottawa police have been overwhelmed by 911 calls intended to disrupt operations, and “they were coming in from the united states,” according to sloly. by far, the largest supporters of the trucker convoy on social media are americans, namely donald trump and elon musk. (one of trump’s former “science advisers” has attended rallies.) republican senator ted cruz is way, way more into the trucker convoy than any canadian conservative is. this episode is no doubt just the beginning of the nightmare of living next to the united states in its time of breakdown. as american politics enters a state of complete toxicity, veering into insurgency, its violence and misinformation networks will inevitably spread across the border.
so why was i, at the trucker convoy in toronto, gripped by a deep physical loathing, true abjection? the truckers are operating on the level of narrative and symbolism. their internal documents, leaked to the guardian, reveal the usual conspiratorial thinking underlying their movement: that world leaders planned the pandemic and the rest of the “great reset” garbage. the truckers disgust me because they believe lies and want to force their lies on the rest of the country. they disgust me because they are not playing by the rules and represent a threat to decent, orderly citizens. if i’m being honest, in some part of my canadian soul they disgust me because they’re making a scene. ultimately, they disgust me because they are so disgusted, and their anger and loathing have now provoked a mirroring anger and loathing in myself.
for the first time, i felt political rage: a sharp rise in testosterone, blinding and stupefying and violent. i am ashamed to have felt it. clearly men should not be in power. our hormones make us too unreliable. testosterone is a hell of a drug. on my way home, i saw stragglers from the convoy lining up outside the japanese-cheesecake bakery and the pot shops that have come to dominate toronto’s urban landscape. i wanted them gone. this was not a healthy desire. the desire to punish, which is the dominant motive of both the left and the right in the united states, is fundamentally stupid. i hoped we could avoid it in canada.
i now have the anger i’ve been studying. i now know what it tastes like. and telling myself that the truckers don’t matter, that the convoy will have exactly zero effect on public-health policy in canada, doesn’t make the anger go away. while i was writing the next civil war, i worked hard at suspending judgment, at concentrating on hearing people and trying to understand their motivations, even if they were nazis or violent criminals. i worked so hard to resist the loathing and the rage. now they are with me, at my doorstep and in my heart. i want nothing to do with either. unfortunately, i know more is coming. when you live next to a junkie, you can expect something flaming to land in your backyard eventually. america is a political-anger junkie; the trucker convoy is something flaming that has landed in our backyard. how do we keep ourselves from burning?

summary
the covid vaccines are basically being forcibly thrust upon our military and nobody is allowed to ask questions, challenge the safety of the vaccine, look at what’s inside the vaccine, or challenge the wisdom of discharging soldiers who refuse to be vaccinated. it is troubling that standard military procedures for vaccines are being bypassed for the covid vaccines.
when a top navy pilot crashes a $100m stealth fighter jet (allegedly 72 hours after his booster), everyone is put under a gag order. that is standard. but crashes like that are not.
what i know for sure is that my military sources tell me that the us military will take all necessary steps to ensure that nobody finds out that the covid vaccines are killing people, jeopardizing the safety of our armed forces, jeopardizing our readiness, and causing untold amounts of damage. just like there was a cover-up when the dod dmed data leaked out, i expect a cover-up here.
so we may never find out what really happened here. this isn’t an honest level playing field.
sources
my sources for the information in this article are members of the military and news sources available on the internet.
i believe the story at real raw news is almost certainly false, but the crash is real.
what happened
real raw news reported the f-35 crash story claiming that an experienced pilot flying a $100m f-35 fighter jet had been boosted 72 hours earlier and experienced a myocarditis incident during landing which caused him to crash land the plane on the deck of the uss carl vinson. the plane quickly slid off the deck and into the sea. the article claimed he muttered “fucking vaccine” right before the crash.
sounds plausible, but did this really happen?
the jet crashed for sure and slid off the deck. that has been verified via leaked footage verified by the navy.
as for the other details, that remains to be determined.
the problem is that mike baxter, who claims to be a former mainstream journalist, writes every story on the site. i was hard pressed to find a single true story on their website. this makes real raw news a very unreliable source in my mind. in short, i wouldn’t believe anything i read on that site.
so lacking further details, the safest assumption is that the story behind the crash is a complete fabrication.
someone else will have to break the story for anyone to have confidence in what really happened.
here are other stories about the incident:
fact check-u.s. navy pilot involved in landing mishap did not eject after having an adverse effect to a covid shot, navy says
leaked video shows harrowing f-35 crash aboard carrier carl vinson
watch: navy verifies leaked footage showing f-35c crash on uss carl vinson
what i learned from my friends in the military
but this story did cause me to reach out to my friends in the military to see if they knew what really happened. what i found when i did that was even more shocking.
the military is being ordered from the top down to take the covid vaccine and not ask any questions. when there are incidents involving the vaccine, a cover story is fabricated so as not to implicate the covid vaccine since doing so could create vaccine hesitancy. the covid vaccines are so controlled in the military that not even the pharmacists or doctors on a military base are permitted to handle them or ask questions. this is unprecedented. when doctors try to ask questions about safety, they are told just to follow orders. again this is unprecedented.
so when an f-35 pilot supposedly gets a covid booster just 72 hours before he has an acute case of myocarditis causing him to crash land and destroy a $100m aircraft, nobody wants to talk about it. it will be under investigation with everyone under a gag order for around 30 days. when that ends, we may find out more. or maybe not. until then, it’s all speculation.
my sources basically say the vaccines are dangerous, they can see the health impacts on the soldiers, that the vaccines don’t work, and that it is insane to discharge soldiers that the military has invested (in some cases) decades of training just because they won’t take a vaccine that biden wants them to take. the number of deaths from covid are trivially small in the military and hardly justifies the purge. it is nonsensical.
in short, the military brass is forcing these vaccines down people’s throats and will not tolerate any discussion. as we saw from the dmed database fiasco, if incriminating evidence is leaked, the military will rapidly cover it up (though the cover-up was sloppy and they are digging themselves even deeper into a hole).
what really happened?
did the pilot just get boosted 72 hours before the crash? was he diagnosed with myocarditis? did he really say “fucking vaccine” before he crashed?
i don’t know but i’m always impressed with what my readers know, so maybe we have a reader or two on board the uss carl vinson who can enlighten us in the comments.
