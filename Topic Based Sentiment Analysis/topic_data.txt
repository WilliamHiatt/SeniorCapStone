https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/05/world-health-organization-global-pandemic-treaty-includes-plan-mandatory-universal-digital-passport-system/
this week, global elitists and world leaders from across the west are gathered in davos, switzerland for the who’s annual world health assembly.
while convened, attendees from all 194 who member countries are set to vote on major amendments to the international health regulations that would effectively strip all power away from sovereign countries and turn it over to the who’s global health board in the event of a pandemic.
if the ratifications are agreed to this week, the who would also be granted sole authority over what constitutes a pandemic. and, as we have seen over the past two years, just about anything qualifies as an ‘existential threat to public health’ including, but not limited to: misinformation, parents protesting at school boards, free speech, and – of course – racism. the fact that the who is on the cusp of unrestricted authority to decide these measures should terrify every american.
what’s more, the changes also include plans for a mandatory and universal vaccine passport system that’s overseen by the who. in fact, the globalist organization has already contracted a german-based company, called ‘t-systems’, to develop the technology.
they’re that confident the measures will be approved.
from the joint who and t-systems announcement:
“the world health organization (who) will make it easier for its member states to introduce digital vaccination certificates in the future. the who is setting up a gateway for this purpose. it enables qr codes on electronic vaccination certificates to be checked across national borders. it is intended to serve as a standard procedure for other vaccinations such as polio or yellow fever after covid-19. the who has selected t-systems as an industry partner to develop the vaccination validation services.”
according to garret mehl – the head of who’s department of digital health and innovation, the plan for the new universal system is to issue a qr code digital id to every single person on the planet – that way, everyone is tracked. but, don’t worry, it’s just a “trust-building” exercise, mehl explains.
oh, is that all?
from mehl (via the brownstone institute):
“vaccination certificates that are tamper-proof and digitally verifiable build trust. who is therefore supporting member states in building national and regional trust networks and verification technology. the who’s gateway service also serves as a bridge between regional systems. it can also be used as part of future vaccination campaigns and home-based records.”
aside from the fact that the who is an international, unelected, and unaccountable body with absolutely no concern for individual freedoms, the organization is led by tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, who repeatedly pushed outright lies and crippling restrictions throughout the china virus pandemic.
needless to say – americans shouldn’t want this guy anywhere near power. but, thanks to treasonous joe biden, the globalist left, and the dc swamp, this globalist organization and its crazed leader will have absolute control.
when you consider the fact that the biden regime purposefully hid the proposed amendments to the treaty when it was submitted in january (therefore, skipping the democratic process) – and only made the proposal public months later (just before the who assembly), we are way beyond an impeachable offense. this is borderline treason.

https://nation.com.pk/08-Apr-2021/russia-offers-pakistan-vaccine-energy-military-equipment
islamabad - russia on wednesday assured pakistan of full cooperation in diverse areas particularly to meet the country’s requirements in energy, security equipment and supply of coronavirus vaccine.
russian foreign minister sergey lavrov in a joint press conference with foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi here at the foreign affairs ministry said substantive talks were held on the early construction of the flagship north-south gas pipeline project between karachi and lahore.
to further support the energy-deficit pakistan, he said his country had offered delivery of russian liquified natural gas (lng) through the russian companies gazprom and novatek and was awaiting response from the partners in pakistan.
the russian foreign minister expressed satisfaction over the growth of bilateral trade by 46 percent and expressed readiness to “further strengthen economic relations”. he mentioned that substantive growth of bilateral trade was mainly due to trade of over 200 millions wheat to pakistan and added, “we want to make this increase sustainable and diversity our trade”.
he said pak-russia intergovernmental commission to meet in moscow the current year would be a key step in defining the sphere of cooperation in multiple areas.
on nuclear energy, he said russia’s rosatom and pakistan’s nuclear energy commission were in touch for cooperation for use of technology for medicine and industry.
both sides agreed to further conduct military exercises, drills
regarding security cooperation, lavrov said russia was ready to “strengthen pakistan’s anti-terrorist capacity including supply of special equipment”. “this serves in the interest of all states of the region,” he said, adding an agreement was today reached on conducting more joint military exercises including the arabian monsoon maritime drill.
since pakistan’s accession to shanghai cooperation organization (sco) three years ago, he said, the country was actively pursuing its anti-terrorist strategy. lavrov expressed concern over the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan and the rise of terrorist activities in north and east of country. he mentioned that russia and pakistan agreed to “further facilitate the agreement among afghan parties through inclusive political dialogue”.
on ties between pakistan and india, the russian foreign minister welcomed the efforts leading towards the normalisation of relations between the two countries.
in the backdrop of tension in middle east, he favoured establishment of the state of palestine, saying that “russia stands to facilitate a direct dialogue between israel and palestine”.
foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi said pakistan was keen to “build a strong multi-dimensional relationship” with russia, considering it a “priority with a new significant approach”.
welcoming the visit of a russian foreign minister “in almost a decade”, he said pakistan regarded russia an as “important factor” in the stability of region. qureshi mentioned that the talks focused on strengthening cooperation in trade, energy, security and cooperation at united nations and said, “in our cooperation, sky is the limit”. he said pakistan in view of its energy needs could greatly benefit from russia.
qureshi said the two countries had scope to cooperate within framework of pak-russia security dialogue and thanked the russian foreign minister for acknowledging pakistan’s role in anti-terrorism. he mentioned briefing his russian counterpart the situation at pakistan’s border with india. he expressed confidence that visit of russian foreign minister would “deepen friendship and high-level contacts” between the two countries.
in response to a question, qureshi said pakistan had registered the russian covid-19 vaccine sputnik in the country which was yielding good results. he said pakistan was looking forward for the russian collaboration for local production of vaccine. the russian foreign minister said his government had provided 50,000 doses to pakistan and intended to supply more 150,000 doses.

a canadian armed forces officer who urged other military members against helping to distribute covid-19 vaccines has pleaded guilty to conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline.
officer cadet laszlo kenderesi pleaded not guilty to behaving in a scandalous manner unbecoming an officer.
military prosecutors have withdrawn a third charge of endeavouring to persuade another person to join in a mutiny, for which the 60-year-old could have faced up to life in prison.
a canadian armed forces officer who publicly urged other military members to disobey orders and not help distribute covid-19 vaccines apologized thursday, saying he regreted his actions and "public display of disloyalty."
officer cadet laszlo kenderesi delivered the apology at the start of his court martial where he was scheduled to be tried on three separate charges, including one of endeavouring to persuade another person to join in a mutiny.
however, military prosecutors told the court shortly after the start of kenderesi's trial at canadian forces base borden that they had withdrawn the mutiny charge, which carried a maximum penalty of up to life in prison.
a short time later, kenderesi pleaded guilty to one charge of conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline before entering a not-guilty plea to the third charge of behaving in a scandalous manner unbecoming an officer.
the charges relate to a speech at an anti-lockdown rally in toronto's dundas square on dec. 5, 2020, in which kenderesi appeared in full military uniform and spoke out against what he called "killer" vaccines.
"i'm calling upon all military personnel to do the same, not to accept any unjust orders, which would be giving out and distributing vaccines," kenderesi told rally participants, according to a transcript read in court.
a video of his comments was later published online.
the armed forces had only days earlier received formal orders to start planning for the distribution of vaccines across the country, as health canada entered the final stages of reviewing vaccine candidates from pfizer and moderna.
on thursday, kenderesi expressed remorse for his actions as military judge cmdr. martin pelletier prepared to sentence the 60-year-old cadet instructor following his guilty plea to conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline.
"it was wrong for me to present myself as a canadian armed forces member to publicly express my private views," kenderesi said. "i abused the trust that comes with the privilege of wearing the canadian armed forces uniform. i'm sorry."
he later added: "it was not my place to question the orders of the chain of command. i breached the core principle of service by not supporting the lawful authority of the chain of command. i'm ashamed of my public display of disloyalty."
in a separate affidavit read into the record, court heard kenderesi was born and grew up in hungary while that country was under the soviet union's influence, and that the covid-19 lockdowns in 2020 affected him both emotionally and financially.
that included his wife losing her job and the collapse of his trucking business, after which he declared bankruptcy.
court also heard that while kenderesi first joined the canadian armed forces in 1978 and served for years as reserve cadet instructor in borden, he had virtually no contact with the military after 2018.
but even as defence lawyer maj. alexandre gelinas-proulx sought to use these as mitigating factors, prosecutor lt.-cmdr. jennifer besner argued that the underlying issue was one of enforcing discipline in the ranks.
"discipline is the quality that every cf member must have, which allows him or her to put the interests of canada and the interests of the canadian forces before personal interests," besner said.
"this is necessary because canadian forces members must willingly and promptly obey lawful orders that may have very devastating personal consequences."
besner and gelinas-proulx nonetheless agreed in asking that pelletier sentence kenderesi to a severe reprimand and $4,200 fine. they added the officer cadet has already served 80 hours of community service.
pelletier appeared to acknowledge the precedent that his ruling would set for future cases, calling it unique due to the context of the pandemic as well as the public nature of the officer cadet's comments.
"it's not an internal rant," pelletier added.
the results of kenderesi's case could indeed have repercussions on future courts martial for armed forces members who have publicly spoken out against vaccine mandates and other government policies.
that includes warrant officer james topp, the army reservist who was charged earlier this year with two counts of conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline for speaking out against vaccine requirements while wearing his uniform.
topp has since become a celebrity of sorts for some canadians opposed to not only vaccines and pandemic restrictions, but also the federal liberal government, and is currently in the midst of a cross-country march.

https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/sweden-to-send-military-aid-to-ukraine-in-break-with-tradition
sweden will break its doctrine of not sending arms to countries engaged in an active conflict, the country's prime minister announced sunday, as the country will send military aid, including anti-tank launchers, helmets and body armor to ukraine.
"sweden is now proposing direct support for ukraine's armed forces. it includes 135,000 field rations, 5,000 helmets, 5,000 body shields and 5,000 anti-tank weapons," prime minister magdalena andersson told a news conference.
andersson underlined that the decision to send this kind of military aid is the first time sweden has sent weapons to a country in an armed conflict since the soviet union invaded finland in 1939.
finland also announced sunday that it is considering whether to send weapons to ukraine directly.
in what would be a departure from its long-standing policy of not allowing weapons to be exported to war zones, finnish defense minister antti kaikkonen said.
the minister also said that finland, which is not a nato member and shares a long border with russia, had given the green light to estonia to send previously finnish-owned field guns to ukraine.
earlier on sunday, european union foreign policy chief josep borrell proposed the idea to eu foreign ministers that eu funds could be used to send weapons and fuel to ukraine.
european commission president ursula von der leyen later said the eu will fund arms supplies to ukraine, ban pro-kremlin media and impose new sanctions on belarus.
asked if finland would send weapons to ukraine directly, kaikkonen said: "we have not ruled that out."
finland will send defense equipment to ukraine, including 2,000 bulletproof vests, 2,000 helmets, 100 stretchers and equipment for two emergency medical care stations, a government statement said.

https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/11/01/air-force-allows-unvaccinated-instructor-pilots-fly-again-amid-pending-lawsuits.html
the air force is allowing instructors who remain unvaccinated against covid-19 to fly again, a change that comes as the result of a pending lawsuit that is stopping the service from punishing those who have refused to get inoculated. the pilots were grounded this summer.
an oct. 25 memo shared with military.com on tuesday issued by maj. gen. phillip stewart, the commander of 19th air force, reverses an aug. 19 decision that kept those unvaccinated teachers from flying.
"instructor pilots, who received final denial of their religious or medical accommodation request for the covid-19 vaccination and requested retirement or separation, will be permitted to fly again until litigation regarding the covid-19 mandate is resolved by the u.s. courts," capt. lauren woods, a spokeswoman for air education and training command, told military.com in an emailed statement.

one of the reasons behind the change is a pending lawsuit filed by troops attached to wright-patterson air force base, ohio, that has led to temporary protections for the more than 9,000 active-duty, active reserve, reserve and national guard members of the air force and space force who asked for a religious exemption from the covid-19 vaccine mandate.
while the oct. 25 memo states that the pending court case "does not affect" the policy that the air force intends to ground unvaccinated flight instructors, but stewart wrote he was reinstating their flying privileges, adding it was "in the best interest of the air force," meaning the policy could change again based on the outcome of the lawsuit.
"this guidance will be reassessed after the final determination of the court," stewart wrote.
nineteenth air force, which is under air education and training command out of joint base san antonio, had grounded the instructor pilots for two months. the policy reversal only applies to instructor pilots, woods said. students who have refused the covid-19 vaccine will still be grounded.
"given the lengthy nature of the administrative exemption process and uncertain outcomes for each specific case, student pilots who have refused the vaccine will remain on administrative hold," woods said in an email. "in order to maximize readiness, training will be prioritized for student pilots who have received the vaccine."
since july 11, the day when the latest figures were released, the department of the air force has administratively separated 834 service members, and nearly 140 airmen and guardians have received religious exemptions.
as of the most recent vaccination data for the department of the air force, 98% of the total force -- active-duty, reserve and air national guard -- had been inoculated against covid-19.
around 12,000 of the 497,000 total personnel in the air force and space force have not been vaccinated.
as of oct. 18, the service had approved more than 1,000 medical and administrative exemptions to the vaccine.
the service members out of wright-patterson who are part of the religious exemption lawsuit are represented by the new york-based siri & glimstad law firm. they were all "found by a chaplain in the air force to hold sincere religious belief substantially burdened by the order to be vaccinated," according to a press release from the firm.
refusers often state that the use of fetal cell lines in the creation of the vaccine prevents them from taking the vaccine because of their views on abortion.
the pfizer and moderna covid-19 vaccines do not need fetal cell lines for development or production but were tested on fetal cell lines replicated from an aborted fetus in the 1970s to ensure their efficacy. only the johnson & johnson vaccine is made using fetal cell lines.
in an attempt to convince some with those religious objections, the air force announced in july that novavax -- a covid-19 vaccine developed without the use of human fetal-derived cell lines or tissue -- would be an option in the near future for airmen and guardians.
"novavax may accommodate those with sincerely held beliefs who felt limited in their options with the previous vaccine offering," maj. gen. sharon bannister, medical operations director, air force surgeon general, said in a statement in july.
since the start of the covid-19 pandemic, there have been approximately 163,000 reported cases of covid-19 in the air force, and 166 deaths, according to the latest data.

heather elkins, 45, couldn’t get a medical exemption from her employer’s covid-19 vaccine mandate despite a pre-existing heart condition — now she can’t work at all.
miss a day, miss a lot. subscribe to the defender's top news of the day. it's free.
when her employer in 2021 mandated all employees get the covid-19 vaccine, heather elkins, who had a pre-existing heart condition, requested a medical exemption.
but the oregon department of human services turned down her application — even though elkins had transitioned, in 2020, to a permanent work-from-home employee.
elkins told the defender:
“all state of oregon employees were mandated by gov. kate brown to be fully vaccinated from covid-19 or to meet a qualifying exemption regardless of if the employee was working from home or not and if we did not comply, we would lose our job!”
elkins, 45, was reluctant to get the vaccine for several reasons, she said:
“i am by no means against vaccines. with that being said, i was not comfortable with the covid-19 vaccine for a number of reasons. first, i didn’t feel like there was enough known about it and the long-term effects it might have.
“second, i saw reports stating people were developing heart issues, and given that i myself have a heart issue, i wasn’t feeling comfortable with getting the vaccine.”
she added: “it’s my body and the decision should be my choice! i know how my body reacts to trauma, illness, etc. i should be able to choose what goes in it.”
elkins tried every available avenue in her attempt to get an exemption. she told the defender:
“i spoke to management, hr and my union, [service employees international union] seiu, multiple times about how uneasy i felt getting the covid-19 vaccine. i also spoke with my doctors … multiple times about my concerns and asked for a medical exemption. they kept advising me to get the vaccine and stated the ‘reward outweighs the risk.’
“i even contacted my cardiologist … and was transferred to my cardiologist’s nurse, who stated: ‘we are not advising on whether or not you should receive the covid-19 vaccine.’”
elkins said given the vaccines were causing heart issues, she thought her cardiologist, of all people, would be willing to weigh in.
“that wasn’t the case here, she said. “they turned a blind eye.”
after she ran out of options — including not meeting the requirements for a religious exemption, either — elkins was forced to choose between the vaccine and her job.
symptoms occurred ‘within an hour’ of first pfizer shot
elkins got the pfizer vaccine on sept. 12, 2021, and “within about an hour,” she said, began experiencing adverse reactions.
the reactions she experienced after the first shot didn’t qualify her for a medical exemption from the second shot, she said:
“i even asked for a medical exemption from the second dose of the vaccine after several visits to the doctor for severe symptoms after receiving the first dose of pfizer.
“i was told that they were not giving medical exemptions because the ‘reward outweighs the risk.’”
so despite continued efforts to secure a medical exemption, elkins received her second pfizer shot on oct. 3, 2021, and experienced “the same severe reaction as with the first dose.”
the symptoms included “severe headache[s], severe muscle aches, [a] racing heartbeat … nausea, severe fatigue and dizziness/balance issues, chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath [and] a severe cough,” she said.
a year later, elkins continues to experience symptoms that affect her ability to work.
elkins told the defender:
“to date, i’m experiencing all the same issues in addition to other symptoms like brain fog, horrible joint pain, pins and needles sensations, painful nerve zaps, shakiness and tremors in my hands and feet, and vision issues.
“at times, some of the symptoms are worse than others, but the symptoms as a whole have been so debilitating daily, i eventually couldn’t continue working and have had to go on workman’s compensation for now.”
prior to getting the vaccines, elkins said she was “living a normal life, walking and jogging several times a week for exercise and living a normal life.”
but now, she said, “i’ve now been mostly confined to my bed for the last 11 months, unable to do minimal activities because of my debilitating symptoms,” she said. “tasks that seemed easy before, like working on crafts, doing the dishes, cooking or a trip to the store is physically exhausting and my symptoms are overwhelming.”
after visiting a succession of doctors — including her primary physician, a covid-19 recovery specialist, a physical therapist, a speech therapist, a cardiologist, a pulmonologist, a rheumatologist, a neurologist and an ophthalmologist — elkins was diagnosed with dysautonomia, a condition characterized by a malfunctioning autonomic nervous system, she said.
“most of the doctors i’ve seen think i’m having some kind of immune response to the vaccine but don’t know why or how to stop it because so little is known.”
she’s tried a variety of medications and treatments, including physical therapy, speech therapy, a clean diet and even celery juice, but “none of them seem to be helping,” elkins said.
“the pulmonologist has me on a steroid inhaler which helps so long as i’m not having long conversations or exerting myself.
she added:
“i have no personal life because every time i try to leave home and do anything social, my symptoms are exacerbated. i spend most of my days in bed. and on good days, i make it out to the living room to rest in a recliner.”
although she was unable to secure a medical exemption for her first or second doses, elkins said that she has “now been told i can have an exemption from the booster” — but only after “multiple visits with multiple doctors,” who told her that the reaction she experienced “is severe.”
elkins said her primary doctor “has since apologized to me verbally for not listening to my concerns when i asked for the medical exemption.”
though too late to help elkins, her employer subsequently removed the mandate, “at the same time they were doing a big hiring push for new employees,” she said.
government ‘sweeping it under the rug, like it isn’t real’
though friends and family have provided some support, they don’t fully understand what she’s experiencing, elkins said.
“either they are supportive quiet, or just try to explain away the reason for my symptoms such as… ‘maybe the vaccine exacerbated a condition you already had that you didn’t know about or that was dormant.’”
elkins, who said she knows “with 100% certainty that i was healthy prior to the covid-19 vaccine,” has found a greater level of support through online support groups for vaccine-injured groups — including the vaccine injury/side effects support group, real not rare and react19.
“they’ve all been a wealth of information,” she said.
even though “it’s sad to hear the stories being shared,” elkins said, “it’s comforting to know that others understand and know what it’s like to go through what you are [going through]. these side effects are debilitating and it is very easy to become depressed, even if you’re someone like me who has never really experienced that in the past.”
she said the people in these support groups are “vital” to healing. “not only are we able to relate to one another, but these ‘perfect strangers’ understand in ways your closest family members and friends can’t.”
elkins hopes these groups — and the vaccine-injured individuals who are speaking out — will translate to pressure on governmental authorities.
“our government needs to take accountability for the lack of transparency with the covid-19 vaccines,” said elkins. “their lack of transparency and shadiness surrounding adverse reactions is hurting so many, but they just continue sweeping it under the rug like it isn’t real or happening.”

https://www.foxnews.com/us/pentagon-rushed-deny-service-members-vaccine-religious-exemption-requests-report
a pentagon report found the military was likely too quick to deny service members religious exemptions to its covid-19 vaccine mandate.
"we found a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by federal law and dod and military service policies," pentagon inspector general sean o'donnell wrote in a memo to defense secretary lloyd austin in june, according to military.com. "some of the appellate decisions included documentation that demonstrated a greater consideration of facts and circumstances involved in a request."
thousands of service members filed for religious exemptions to the covid-19 vaccine after it was mandated by austin in august 2021, but only a fraction of those who made the requests were approved.

the military mandates vaccinations and medical treatments for a variety of illnesses, including flu and smallpox. service members can be excused from those treatments only with an approved religious exemption, but the inspector general found the process for denying such requests for the covid-19 vaccine revealed "concerning" trends.

"the volume and rate at which decisions were made to deny requests is concerning," the memo to austin said. "assuming a 10-hour work day with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes for each package. such a review period seems insufficient to process each request in an individualized manner and still perform the duties required of their position."
a group of gop lawmakers on monday demanded answers from austin on what they called "blanket denial of religious accommodation" in response to the memo.

"as of february 2022, the department of the navy had granted only a single, partial exemption to its covid-19 vaccine mandate on religious grounds, and as of july 2022 the department of the u.s. army had approved just 20 of over 8,000 requests, the department of the air force had approved less than 130 of over 9,000 requests, and the u.s. marines had only approved seven of over 3,700 requests," said the group, which was led by republican reps. jim banks of indiana and darrell issa of california.
the pentagon did not immediately respond to a fox news' request for comment.

https://fox40.com/news/political-connection/house-passes-stopgap-bill-to-prevent-shutdown/
this is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.
(the hill) — the house on tuesday passed a stopgap measure to extend federal government funding until march 11 to prevent a shutdown next week while negotiations over a longer-term package remain ongoing.
the chamber voted 272-162 to pass the short-term funding bill on tuesday evening, just one day before the house is set to be out of session until the week of feb. 28. a total of 51 house republicans joined all but one democrat in support of the measure.
the senate is expected to act swiftly on the legislation. senate majority leader charles schumer (d-n.y.) said tuesday that he intends for the upper chamber to “take it up quickly and in time” before current government funding expires next friday, feb. 18.
the legislation buys congressional negotiators on both sides of the aisle time to strike a larger spending deal known as an omnibus to fund government operations for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends in late september.
if passed by the house and senate, the continuing resolution will mark the third time congress has had to resort to such measures to prevent a shutdown for the current fiscal year that began oct. 1, as lawmakers struggle to reach a bipartisan agreement on spending.
the house, where democrats hold the majority, has so far passed 9 out of 12 of its annual appropriations bills. but none have passed in the 50-50 split senate, where democrats would need the support of all the party’s members and 10 republican votes to pass such legislation.
leaders on both sides of the aisle have their sights set on securing a deal on a massive omnibus spending package for fiscal 2022, but disagreements in major areas, including defense and nondefense spending, as well as policy riders, have slowed efforts.
sen. richard shelby (r-ala.), the ranking republican on senate appropriations committee, told reporters on tuesday that leaders have continued to meet and have been trading spending offers.
“we’re close,” shelby said, though he added leaders are “not there” yet.
congressional appropriators have also bemoaned the lack of an agreement on an overall topline number as spending talks drag out, making it difficult for those charged with helping craft spending legislation to complete their work.
“what’s preventing us from getting a deal is a lack of agreement on top lines … because once you get top lines, then you are then you have all of these complicated issues within each subcommittee,” sen. chris murphy (d-conn.), who chairs the appropriations subcommittee on homeland security, told the hill.
rep. kay granger (r-texas), top ranking member on the house appropriations committee, told reporters on monday that she’s “hopeful” she and other leading negotiators will come to a topline agreement later this week.
house appropriations committee chairwoman rosa delauro (d-conn.) also said on the floor on tuesday afternoon that she believes leaders are “very close” to an agreement on spending, adding she is “eager to move this process forward.”
“i have every expectation that we can finalize a framework in short order, and then work together to fill in the details and enact an omnibus,” she said.
the last effort to swiftly pass a stopgap measure to prevent a shutdown in december ran into resistance from republicans who vowed to oppose any spending bill that would implement the biden administration’s covid-19 vaccine mandates.
those republicans ultimately relented to allow a swift vote to prevent a government shutdown after they secured a vote on amendment to prevent enforcement of the vaccine mandate for large businesses.
since then, the supreme court last month blocked the biden administration’s vaccine-or-test mandate for large employers. but the court did allow a vaccine mandate for health providers at federally funded facilities to stand.
nearly 50 republicans in the house and senate signed a letter last week led by rep. chip roy (r-texas) vowing to oppose any federal spending bill that funds the enforcement of covid-19 vaccine mandates “at any level of government.”
at least 10 senate republicans will have to join with democrats to advance the stopgap measure when it reaches the upper chamber. but only four gop senators — sens. mike lee (utah), rand paul (ky.), ron johnson (wis.) and ted cruz (texas) — have signed onto the pledge to oppose any funding that allows implementation of vaccine mandates.

share comment on this story comment
on aug. 30, 1954, bernice e. eddy, a veteran scientist at the national institutes of health in bethesda, md., was checking a batch of a new polio vaccine for safety. created by jonas salk, the vaccine was hailed as the miracle drug that would conquer the dreaded illness that killed and paralyzed children. eddy’s job was to examine samples submitted by the companies planning to make it.
as she checked a sample from cutter laboratories in berkeley, calif., she noticed that the vaccine designed to protect against the disease had instead given polio to a test monkey. rather than containing killed virus to create immunity, the sample from cutter contained live, infectious virus.
something was wrong. “there’s going to be a disaster,” she told a friend.
as scientists and politicians desperately search for medicines to slow the deadly coronavirus, and as president trump touts a malaria drug as a remedy, a look back to the 1955 polio vaccine tragedy shows how hazardous such a search can be, especially under intense public pressure.
despite eddy’s warnings, an estimated 120,000 children that year were injected with the cutter vaccine, according to paul a. offit, director of the vaccine education center at children’s hospital of philadelphia.

roughly 40,000 got “abortive” polio, with fever, sore throat, headache, vomiting and muscle pain. fifty-one were paralyzed, and five died, offit wrote in his 2005 book, “the cutter incident: how america’s first polio vaccine led to the growing vaccine crisis.”
it was “one of the worst biological disasters in american history: a man-made polio epidemic,” offit wrote.
in those days, polio, or infantile paralysis, was a terror.
“a national poll … found that polio was second only to the atomic bomb as the thing that americans feared most,” offit wrote.
“people weren’t sure how you got it,” he said in an interview last week. “therefore, they were scared of everything. they didn’t want to buy a piece of fruit at the grocery store. it’s the same now. … everybody’s walking around with gloves on, with masks on, scared to shake anybody’s hand.”
advertisement
“i remember my mother … wouldn’t let us go to a public swimming pool,” said offit, 69. we “all had to go into one of those little plastic pools in the back so that we wouldn’t be in a public place.”
the worst polio outbreak in u.s. history struck in 1952, the year after offit was born. it infected 57,000 people, paralyzed 21,000 and killed 3,145. the next year there were 35,000 infections, and 38,000 the year after that.
many survivors had to wear painful metal braces on their paralyzed legs or had to be placed in so-called iron lungs, which helped them breathe. there was no vaccine and few treatments. (one bogus approach was to spray acid into the noses of children to block the virus. all it did was ruin the sense of smell.)
often polio victims were children, but the most famous affected american was president franklin d. roosevelt, who got polio and was paralyzed from the waist down in 1921 when he was 39.
advertisement
in 1951, jonas salk of the university of pittsburgh’s medical school received a grant from the national foundation for infantile paralysis to find a vaccine. during intense months of research, he took live polio virus and killed it with formaldehyde until it was not infectious but still provided virus-fighting antibodies.
when tests showed that the vaccine was safe, salk told his wife, “i’ve got it,” offit wrote.
word of his success soon leaked out. public pressure grew for the vaccine and for a large-scale trial.
in 1953, salk tested it on himself, his wife and three children.
on april 26, 1954, randy kerr, a 6-year-old second-grader from falls church, va., stood in the cafeteria of the franklin sherman elementary school in mclean and became the first to be vaccinated in a massive field study.
advertisement
salk’s vaccine was given to 420,000 children. a placebo was given to 200,000. and 1.2 million were given nothing.
the study found that children who did not get the vaccine were three times more likely to be paralyzed with polio than those who received the vaccine.
a year later, on april 12, 1955, when officials announced the results at a news conference at the university of michigan, there was jubilation. reporters hollered: “it works! it works!” offit wrote.
the news made front-page headlines across the country. “people wept,” offit said. “there were parades in jonas salk’s honor. … that’s what contributed to the tragedy of cutter more than anything else … the irony.”
that same day, licenses were hurriedly granted to several drug companies, including cutter laboratories, to make the vaccine.
but the officials granting the licenses were never told of eddy’s findings, offit wrote.

the year before, eddy’s scrutiny of the cutter vaccine had continued through the summer and fall.

it must have been a difficult time. she was 52. her husband, jerald guy wooley, 64, a fellow national institutes of health scientist, had died suddenly the previous april, leaving her with three daughters, two of them still at home in bethesda, according to his obituary. her mother moved in to help out.
eddy was born in 1903 in glen dale, w.va., a small town on the ohio river, south of wheeling, according to a 1985 biographical sketch by elizabeth moot o’hern. her father was a doctor.
she had started at nih in 1937, had headed testing of vaccines for influenza, and in 1954 was asked to help test the salk polio vaccine. the pressure was intense. “for weeks she and her staff worked around-the-clock, seven days a week,” o’hern wrote.

“this was a product that had never been made before, and they were going to use it right away,” eddy had said.
she began testing cutter’s samples in august 1954 and continued through november, according to a later report in the congressional record. she found that three of the six samples paralyzed test monkeys.
“what do you think is wrong with these monkeys?” she asked a colleague, offit recounted.
“they were given polio,” the colleague replied.
“no,” eddy said. “they were given the … vaccine.”
eddy’s discovery suggested that cutter’s manufacturing process was flawed. its vaccine should have contained only killed virus.
she reported her findings to william workman, head of the nih laboratory of biologics control.
but amid the scientific and bureaucratic chaos, workman never told the licensing committee, offit wrote.
advertisement
starting on the evening of april 12, 1955, batches of the salk vaccine made by five drug firms were shipped out in boxes marked “polio vaccine: rush.”
about 165,000 doses of cutter’s went out.
within weeks, reports of mysterious polio infections started coming in.
on april 27, 7-year-old susan pierce, of pocatello, idaho, died of polio days after getting the cutter vaccine. she had been placed in an iron lung just before she died. her brother kenneth had been vaccinated at the same time, but he was okay.
other cases followed.
alton ochsner, a professor of surgery at tulane medical school and founder of the ochsner clinic in new orleans, gave the vaccine to his grandson eugene davis, offit wrote. the child died may 4.
not only did some people injected with the tainted vaccine get sick, but some who got the vaccine went on to infect family members and neighbors.
advertisement
on june 5, 1955, 33-year-old annabelle nelson of montpelier, idaho, died of polio after her two children had been given the vaccine in april, according to news reports at the time.
the government ordered the cutter vaccine withdrawn on april 27. but damage had been done.
“by april 30, within forty-eight hours of the recall,” offit wrote. “cutter’s vaccine had paralyzed or killed twenty-five children: fourteen in california, seven in idaho, two in washington, one in illinois, and one in colorado.”
on may 6, all polio vaccinations were postponed. they were resumed on may 15 after the government had rechecked the vaccines for safety. but people were still frightened.
offit recalled his mother asking their doctor: “what’s the story? should we be getting this vaccine or not?"
eventually, he was vaccinated when he was about 6 years old.
years later, in a suit brought against cutter, the firm was found not negligent in making its vaccine because it had done its best making a new drug that was complicated to produce.
but it was found financially liable for the calamity it had caused during that spring of 1955.
the jury foreman said: “cutter laboratories [brought] to market a … vaccine which when given to plaintiffs caused them to come down with polio.”

the pentagon announced that all active-duty service members will have to be vaccinated against covid-19. the announcement comes on the same day the u.s. food and drug administration granted full approval to pfizer's mrna vaccine.
"we're going to move forward, making that vaccine mandatory. we're preparing the guidance to the force right now. and the actual completion date of it, in other words, how fast we want to see it get done, we're working through that guidance right now," pentagon press secretary john kirby said during a press conference.
earlier in the month, defense secretary lloyd austin announced that he asked president joe biden to grant a waiver to add the covid vaccines to a list of required immunizations for service members. now that the pfizer vaccine has been fully approved by the fda, the pentagon does not need a waiver from president biden to require troops to get vaccinated.
kirby refused to comment on the moderna vaccine, which is still being distributed under an emergency use authorization by the fda.
"i don't want to get ahead of decisions that haven't been made yet," he said.
the requirement would apply to roughly 1.3 million service members. as of august 18, just over one million service members have been fully vaccinated, and nearly 245,000 have received at one dose. there have been over 220,000 cases of covid in the armed forces, and 34 troops have died since the start of the global pandemic.

solid tumor diagnosed after vax
new aggressive cancers are killing people soon after covid vax…including children.
13 yo f. 1 month after pf vax, had vague upper back pain. over the next 6 weeks, she developed fatigue, chest pain, sore throat and cough. all viral workup was negative and was treated for pneumonia. by 8 weeks after vax, she developed increased heart rate and symptoms worsened. she was found to have fluid around her heart. this was drained and shown to have heart muscle cancer cells. over the next 30 days, she grew a massive tumor inside the left atrium of her heart. it continued to grow rapidly despite aggressive chemotherapy and the child died less than 1 month later. vaers id 1913198
death—73 year old male diagnosed with liver cancer 13 days after vax, that metastasized to the lungs and lymphatics a month later. liver cancer doubled in size 13 days after that.

washington (ap) — four cadets at the air force academy may not graduate or be commissioned as military officers this month because they have refused the covid-19 vaccine, and they may be required to pay back thousands of dollars in tuition costs, according to air force officials.
it’s the only military academy, so far, where cadets may face such penalties. the army and navy said that as of now, not one of their seniors is being prevented from graduating at the u.s. military academy at west point, new york, or the naval academy in annapolis, maryland, due to vaccine refusals. the graduations are in about two weeks.
defense secretary lloyd austin last year made the covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members, including those at the military academies, saying the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force.
military leaders have argued that troops for decades have been required to get as many as 17 vaccines in order to maintain the health of the force, particularly those deploying overseas. students arriving at the military academies get a regimen of shots on their first day — such as measles, mumps and rubella – if they aren’t already vaccinated. and they routinely get regular flu shots in the fall.
members of congress, the military and the public have questioned if the exemption reviews by the military services have been fair. there have been multiple lawsuits filed against the mandate, mainly centering on the fact that very few service members have been granted religious exemptions from the shots.
until the covid-19 vaccine, very few military members sought religious exemptions to any vaccines.
lt. col. brian maguire, an air force academy spokesman, said that while vaccination status may hinder the graduation of the four seniors, “there are still two weeks until graduation, so their status could change as the cadets weigh their options.”
according to maguire, the four cadets — who are not named — have been informed of the potential consequences, and have met with the academy’s superintendent. in addition to those four, there are two juniors, one sophomore and six freshmen at the academy who have also refused the vaccine.
the military academies for years have required students under certain circumstances to repay tuition costs if they leave during their junior or senior year. often those involve students with disciplinary issues or similar problems. the costs can be as much as $200,000, or more, and any final decision on repayment is made by the service secretary.
west point said that there are no members of the class of 2022 who have refused to get the vaccine.
across the military, the army, navy, air force and marine corps have discharged nearly 4,000 active duty service members for refusing the vaccine. according to recent data released by the services, more than 2,100 marines, 900 sailors, 500 army soldiers and 360 airmen have been thrown out of the military, and at least 50 were discharged during entry level training, before they moved into active duty service.
those who flatly refuse the vaccine without seeking an exemption are still being discharged. but the courts have stalled additional discharges of service members who sought religious exemptions.
last month, a federal judge in texas barred the navy from taking action for now against sailors who have objected to being vaccinated on religious grounds.
u.s. district judge reed o’connor had, in january, issued a preliminary injunction preventing the navy from disciplining or discharging 35 sailors who sued over the navy’s vaccine policy while their case played out. in april, o’connor agreed the case could go forward as a class action suit and issued a preliminary injunction covering about 4,000 sailors who have objected on religious grounds to being vaccinated.
also last month, a federal judge in ohio granted a preliminary injunction blocking the air force from disciplining a dozen officers and some additional airmen and reservists who were seeking religious exemptions. the officers, mostly from wright-patterson air force base near dayton, ohio, sued in february after their exemption requests were denied.
according to the military, as many as 20,000 service members have asked for religious exemptions. thousands have been denied.
as of recent data, the air force has approved 73 religious exemptions, the marine corps has approved seven, and the army has approved eight. before the injunction, the navy conditionally approved one reservist and 26 active-duty requests for religious exemptions, and 10 requests from members of the individual ready reserve. the irr approvals mean that those sailors don’t have to be vaccinated until they are actually called to serve.
about 99% of the active duty navy and 98% of the air force, marine corps and army have gotten at least one shot.

a federal judge in ohio blocked the air force’s plan to expel thousands of unvaccinated service members and enforcing the vaccine requirement against covid-19 on thursday.
american military news reported that trump-appointed judge matthew w. mcfarland of ohio’s southern district granted a temporary restraining order after service members sued the air force secretary to provide religious exemptions to the covid-19 vaccine mandate.
“mcfarland’s ruling grants class status in a class action lawsuit to airmen, space force guardians, air national guardsmen and air force academy and air force reserve officer training corps (afrotc) cadets who submitted a religious accommodation request for the vaccine mandate from sept. 1, 2021, to the present, and who were confirmed by an air force chaplain as having had a sincerely held religious belief, and who either had their requests denied or still-pending accommodations,” the news outlet reported.
“the court issues a temporary restraining order prohibiting defendants from enforcing the vaccine mandate against any class member, to expire 14 days from the entry of this order,” mcfarland wrote in his ruling.
judge mcfarland ordered the defendants to write a 10-page supplemental brief by july 21, 2022, explaining why he should not extend the temporary restraining order.
back in april, judge matthew mcfarland granted an order to block the military temporarily from disciplining 18 u.s. air force officers, airmen, and reservists, including 11 who currently or recently served at wright-patterson in dayton, until their lawsuit is resolved.

as of the air force’s latest vaccination statistics posted tuesday, 6,803 members were denied religious accommodation requests, while 2,847 requests remain pending, and only 104 were approved. approximately 2.9% of the air force’s entire ranks remain unvaccinated. the service has already kicked out 834 members. mat staver, the founder and chairman of liberty counsel — a religious freedom organization that has been supporting the air force plaintiffs in their lawsuit — said, “this is a great decision that grants protection for the religious freedom for all air force personnel from joe biden’s unlawful covid shot mandate.” “no service member should be required to choose between service to the country and service to god. liberty counsel will be pursuing class-wide protection for the remaining branches of the military,” staver added. daniel schmid, an attorney for liberty counsel, told american military news that liberty counsel is aware of service members within the lawsuit class who have begun to receive their separation packages but that no service members in the class have hit their separation dates and that the judge’s order will pause those separations for now. schmid also said mcfarland’s decision to grant a temporary restraining order is an indicator that the plaintiffs can expect him to grant a longer preliminary injunction soon that could last for the duration of their lawsuit against the air force.
the gateway pundit reported earlier this month that the united states air force began issuing its first cuts, including a highly-decorated, 19-year veteran master sergeant named nick kupper.
in an appearance with tucker carlson on wednesday, kupper blasted biden’s “illegal” mandates and warned that tens of thousands of other military members are facing the same fate for refusing the vaccine – unbelievably, as much as 10% of the entire us military could get the ax, according to kupper.

https://www.theepochtimes.com/court-denies-biden-administration-attempt-to-impose-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-on-navy-seals_4309017.html
a federal appeals court on feb. 28 rejected an attempt by president joe biden's administration to partially lift a block on the military's covid-19 vaccine mandate for a group of navy seals.
a federal judge in january blocked the mandate's enforcement for 35 navy members, many of them seals, ruling that while the navy had provided a process for adjudicating religious exemption applications, “by all accounts, it is theater.”
at the time of the ruling, the navy had granted zero religious exemptions. as of feb. 23, it had still granted none.
nonetheless, officials asked the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit to allow the military to take into account the unvaccinated status of the 35 members when making "deployment, assignment and other operational decisions." they argued that "forcing the navy to deploy plaintiffs while they are unvaccinated threatens the success of critical missions and needlessly endangers the health and safety of other service members.”
a three-judge panel on the court rejected the request , noting the discrepancy between how the branch has handled medical and religious exemption requests.
"the navy has granted hundreds of medical exemptions from vaccination requirements, allowing those service members to seek medical waivers and become deployable. but it has not accommodated any religious objection to any vaccine in seven years, preventing those seeking such accommodations from even being considered for medical waivers," the panel said.
judges said there is apparently no template for approving requests, but there is a disapproval template form. and during the process, navy officials sent memorandums to vice admiral john nowell asking that he disapprove the exemption requests, even those based on " sincerely held religious beliefs ."
the navy has "has effectively stacked the deck against even those exemptions supported by plaintiffs’ immediate commanding officers and military chaplains," emphasizing the futility of pursuing exemptions, the panel said. further, letting 35 unvaccinated members deploy wouldn't seriously impede military function because over 5,000 other members are still on duty despite being unvaccinated, they added.
"defendants have not demonstrated 'paramount interests' that justify vaccinating these 35 plaintiffs against covid-19 in violation of their religious beliefs," the ruling stated.
the panel consisted of judges edith jones, a reagan nominee; stuart duncan, a trump nominee; and kurt engelhardt, a trump nominee.
mike berry, director of military affairs for first liberty institute, which is representing the plaintiffs, said the group was grateful for the ruling.
“the purge of religious servicemembers is not just devastating to morale, but it harms america’s national security. it’s time for our military to honor its constitutional obligations and grant religious accommodations for service members with sincere religious objections to the vaccine," berry said in a statement.
the navy declined to comment.

facing the disintegration of his climate agenda as ferocious heatwaves hit large parts of the world, joe biden has unveiled a new plan to push billions of dollars to us cities and states to help them cope better with extreme heat.
the president stopped short, however, of declaring a climate emergency.
biden outlined the new actions in a speech on wednesday at a former coal plant in massachusetts, which is now part of an offshore windfarm project.
“as president, i have a responsibility to act with urgency and resolve when our nation faces clear and present danger,” biden said. “and that’s what climate change is about. it is literally, not figuratively, a clear and present danger. the health of our citizens and our communities is literally at stake.”
02:45 joe biden unveils $2.3bn plan to tackle extreme heat – video
the initiatives are aimed at helping salvage the president’s tattered climate agenda, which has endured a torrid month.
last week, joe manchin, a west virginia democratic senator who owns a coal company, appeared to rule out supporting a new clean energy bill, seemingly dooming it in the evenly split senate.
the blow arrived just two weeks after the conservative-dominated supreme court restricted the ability of the federal government to curb emissions from power plants.
biden, speaking from a lectern set up on a rock pile to an audience that included democratic legislators, said: “climate change is literally an existential threat to our nation and to the world. so my message today is this: since congress is not acting as it should - and these guys here are, but we’re not getting many republican votes - this is an emergency. an emergency. and i will look at it that way.”
biden’s actions include $2.3bn in funding to help communities prepare for heatwaves, droughts and floods, new guidance that allows the federal government to help provide cooling centers and air conditioning, and new planned offshore wind energy leases for the gulf of mexico coast.
“right now, there are millions of people suffering from extreme heat at home so my team is also working with the states to deploy $385m right now. for the first time, states will be able to use federal funds to pay for air conditioners in homes, set up community cooling centres in schools where people can get through these extreme heat crises.”
the stakes of inaction on the climate crisis have been made starkly apparent this week, with more than 100 million americans in grip of a dangerous heatwave that has pushed temperatures as high as 115f (46c) in parts of the country.
elsewhere, disastrous wildfires have strafed france, spain and portugal, and the uk has endured its first ever recorded day of 40c heat.
the white house said the heatwaves showed the climate crisis is a “clear and present danger” to the us.
climate campaigners hoped biden would declare a climate state of emergency. karine jean-pierre, the white house press secretary, said that wouldn’t happen on wednesday but added that the option is “still on the table”.
the lack of such a declaration, or any sweeping ban of oil and gas drilling on public lands, is unlikely to satisfy those who have called for more vigorous action.
“biden must declare a climate emergency, ban crude oil exports and halt new fossil fuel infrastructure, including pipelines and export terminals,” said wenonah hauter, executive director of food & water watch.
“the clock is rapidly ticking towards inevitable, irreversible climate catastrophe. there is no more time to lose.”
some democrats have urged the president to declare a national emergency, which would allow him to block crude oil imports or direct the military to work on renewable energy production.
“for too long we have been waiting for a single piece of legislation, and a single senate vote, to take bold action on our climate crisis,” a group of senators including the leading progressives bernie sanders and elizabeth warren, wrote to biden this week.
“as a result, we urge you to put us on an emergency footing and aggressively use your executive powers to address the climate crisis.”
but it is unclear whether such an extraordinary use of presidential powers, normally used in a military context, would survive if challenged in the rightwing-dominated supreme court, or if it would be enough to make a significant dent in planet-heating emissions.
“declaring a climate emergency doesn’t lower any emissions,” conceded sheldon whitehouse, a democratic senator from rhode island. “you have to move on to acting like it’s a climate emergency, and i’m looking forward to those steps.”
biden may take further action this week by directing new regulations to cut pollution from cars, trucks and power plants.
but the window of opportunity to avoid disastrous climate change is rapidly closing.
scientists have said the world must slash emissions in half this decade, and phase them out entirely by 2050, if catastrophically worse heatwaves, floods, drought and other climate impacts are to be averted. the us will fall about halfway short of such a goal absent any significant congressional action, even with presidential orders, analysts have forecast.
“president biden cannot do it alone,” said heather zichal, chief executive of the american clean power association. “we urge congress to get back to the table and come to a consensus on clean energy provisions that our country so desperately needs.”
biden’s remarks on wednesday were attended by political allies including john kerry, the special presidential envoy for climate; massachusetts senators warren and ed markey; whitehouse of rhode island and massachusetts congressmen jake auchincloss and bill keating.
the president promised executive actions in the coming weeks. “when it comes to fighting climate change, i will not take no for an answer. i will do everything in my power to clean our air and water, protect our people’s health, to win the clean energy future.”
in an unexpected digression, he also recalled growing up in claymont, delaware, near polluting oil refineries. “you had to put on your windshield wipers to get literally the oil slick off the window. that’s why i and so damn many other people i grew up have cancer.”
the white house released a health summary from biden’s doctor last november that said: “he has had several localized, non-melanoma skin cancers removed with mohs surgery before he started his presidency.”
climate activists applauded biden’s pledge to do more to tackle global heating but some lamented the lack of an emergency declaration.
“president biden’s announcements, while welcome, don’t even scratch the surface of what’s needed and what communities suffering most are demanding,” said collin rees, us program manager at oil change international. “biden’s climate legacy hangs in the balance – we’re in desperate need of bold leadership, not tinkering around the edges while the world burns.”
varshini prakash, executive director of the youth-led sunrise movement, added: “young people are tired of receiving scraps from our government. president biden must immediately declare a climate emergency, and do everything in his executive power to confront the climate crisis.”

https://www.theepochtimes.com/canadian-military-expected-to-suspend-vaccine-mandate-this-summer-report_4616017.html?utm_source=ref_share&utm_campaign=tw&rs=SHRFJKGHK
the canadian armed forces (caf) is looking to follow the federal public service and suspend their vaccine mandate, the ottawa sun reported thursday.
the newspaper obtained a leaked copy of a new draft covid-19 directive from the chief of defence staff (cds) wayne eyre.
it states that members of the caf will no longer need to attest of their vaccination status, nor will new recruits be required to be fully vaccinated.
but like for public servants and the federally regulated sectors, it appears the policy is only suspended and not completely abolished.
unvaccinated public servants were allowed back to work on june 20, but ottawa said the vaccine mandate could be brought back if it deems it necessary.
“suspending the requirement for caf members to be fully vaccinated against covid-19 will require significant administrative effort to address the files of members who were not compliant with the cds directives on caf covid-19 vaccination,” the draft reportedly says.
an unidentified spokesperson from the department of national defence (dnd) told the epoch times it would not comment on “leaked documents or speculative plans.”
“the current, existing directive will continue to apply until otherwise stated.”
the leaked draft suggests that unvaccinated caf members won’t be completely scot-free. it reportedly says that those who went through administrative reviews and have future release dates will still be discharged.
other disciplinary procedures will be stopped, but they will leave a mark on the members’ files.
reactions “this is a good step in the right direction for the caf and the federal government’s disgraceful treatment of our active duty military members,” says andrew macgillivray, spokesperson for the new policy also says that members who were dishonourably discharged under the 5(f) mention, “unsuitable for further service,” will be allowed to re-enrol, but only with approval from the cds.“this is a good step in the right direction for the caf and the federal government’s disgraceful treatment of our active duty military members,” says andrew macgillivray, spokesperson for veterans for freedom (v4f), a civil liberties advocacy group composed of former caf members.
“i'm unsure if they will ever rid the stain of this which will no doubt, amongst other things, have a negative impact on recruiting.”
macgillivray wonders if discharged members who have cashed out their pensions, taking sometimes huge losses, will be able to buy back in.
and “how about a written apology from the cds or the mnd [minister of national defence]?” he asks.
the epoch times previously reported on the stories of several caf members who were ousted for refusing covid-19 vaccination and reached out to them for reactions.
“i think it’s a win for current serving members and veterans released under 5(f). it’s an opportunity for caf members to continue their career if they choose to do so,” says nicholas collins, who served four years as a vehicle technician before being released under 5(f).
but collins says it doesn’t entirely “fix the problem that the government created.”
“there will be lots of veterans that were released for not getting the covid shot that will choose not to re-enlist, including myself. the trust is broken and it can’t be repaired.”
former logistics officer natasha lis, who served 18 years and was released voluntarily to avoid a dishonourable discharge, believes the rapid suspension of the mandate less than a year after its implementation is a sign it was political rather than based on an operation requirement.
she also cautions about the suspension, which doesn’t mean a full repeal.
“any unvaccinated members who are able to re-enrol will have to worry about reimplementation of the mandate, continuation of the remedial measure and administrative review processes, and retaliation and discrimination from their chain of command and peers,” she says.
“why would anyone want to rejoin and be subject to that? an apology is due and all of the unethical policy actions taken need to be walked back.”
sandra carmichael, who served for 25 years and worked in the communications branch, echoed lis’s comments.
she says she wouldn’t consider joining back unless the mandate is fully repealed and there’s an acknowledgement that such policies should not be implemented.
carmichael said the caf needs to “recognize that they can’t do that.”
“for me that’s clear, it’s not respecting my rights and i don’t have to subject my body to anything that the government or the caf, or anybody, tells me.”

u.s. army begins to discharge soldiers who refuse covid-19 vaccination
enlarge this image toggle caption tech. sgt. anthony nelson/department of defense via ap tech. sgt. anthony nelson/department of defense via ap
u.s. army soldiers who refuse to be vaccinated for covid-19 will soon be discharged, the military branch announced wednesday.
the army said it will "immediately begin separating soldiers from the service" who refuse to be vaccinated or who don't have an approved or pending request for exemption.
"army readiness depends on soldiers who are prepared to train, deploy, fight and win our nation's wars," said secretary of the army christine wormuth. "unvaccinated soldiers present risk to the force and jeopardize readiness."
soldiers who are discharged for refusing to be vaccinated "will not be eligible for involuntary separation pay" and may have to return any unearned special or incentive pay, the army said.
as of jan. 26, it said, 96% of active troops have been completely vaccinated, while 3,350 soldiers have refused to get the vaccine. nearly 5,900 have received temporary exemptions.
those who have asked for a medical exemption or religious accommodations are temporarily exempt from the vaccination requirement while their requests are being reviewed.
"to date, army commanders have relieved a total of six regular army leaders, including two battalion commanders, and issued 3,073 general officer written reprimands to soldiers for refusing the vaccination order," the army said late last month.
the pentagon began requiring members of the military to get vaccinated last summer.

https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/canadian-service-members-go-court-stop-military-covid-vaccine-mandate
as u.s. service members ramp up their legal challenges to military covid-19 vaccine mandates, their canadian counterparts are joining the action.
the justice centre for constitutional freedoms (jccf) said tuesday it had filed "the first of many [planned] injunctions" against the dismissal of canadian armed forces (caf) members for refusing the shots "on the basis of health concerns, religious or conscientious objections."
the canadian civil liberties group has received "hundreds of requests" for help since january from active-duty members who are facing removal under the item 5(f) process, it said in a press release.
caf considers them "unsuitable for further service" because they developed "personal weakness or behaviour" due to factors "wholly or chiefly ... within [their] control" by refusing covid vaccines.
canada's department of national defence confirmed to canadian news organization true north in november that members of the armed forces risk removal as "unsuitable" unless they get an approved accommodation. caf's vaccination rate was 98.3% in january when it launched formal proceedings against more than 900 members for noncompliance, the canadian press reported.
legal challenges are much further along below the border. navy seals with religious objections, represented by first liberty institute, won a reprieve in january from a federal judge, who then expanded their action into a class-action suit covering the entire service in march. the navy said may 25 it has granted 28 religious accommodations.
air force service members also represented by the christian legal defense nonprofit recently requested a "class wide temporary restraining order" after their religious exemptions were denied. only 68 exemptions have been approved.
jccf's first client to go to court is shannon jones, "a healthy and skilled" caf member who stands to lose her pension unless her injunction is approved at next week's hearing. director of communications marnie cathcart told just the news it wasn't sharing its filings "at this time."
"this is fundamentally a patched together policy designed to punish those who do not get in line with the political objectives assigned to [department of national defence] policy from ottawa," said the lawyer commissioned for the project, phillip millar.
the vaccine mandate has "nothing to do with operational effectiveness as it is simply a political move imposed on the military by the federal government," he said in jccf's release.
a former combat officer and assistant crown attorney who says he has won compensation cases for sexual assault victims and cleared the "wrongfully accused," millar recently applied to join the "hardcore litigation department" billionaire elon musk is building at tesla. he calls himself a "samurai for hire" on twitter.
millar told just the news these were his first covid vaccine cases for service members. he has previously represented university professors put on unpaid leave on the same grounds.
he expects one or two injunction hearings per month and is planning to add cases on behalf of unvaccinated youth who are prevented from training in the "army cadet" program.
millar believes caf chose the "unsuitable" administrative removal process because a vaccine-specific rule lets members challenge their removal in court. if he can secure injunctions for clients, they can remain in the service while finishing the multiyear grievance process, millar said.
jccf kicked off the legal effort a month ago with 16 caf members, including 28-year reservist james topp, who faces court martial for "conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline."
he posted a tik tok video in which a uniformed topp says he's on unpaid leave "because i will not change my vaccination status," the cbc reported. the video did not violate a military policy on "people in uniform making political statements" because topp was "speaking about a policy that directly affects him and his conviction," millar said.
topp is walking across canada to protest covid mandates and support those punished for noncompliance or coerced into compliance, chronicling his journey on tik tok for the past few months. he reached the lake superior town of marathon on monday.
he started his journey from vancouver on feb. 20, the same day police cracked down on freedom convoy protesters in ottawa under prime minister justin trudeau's unprecedented invocation of the emergencies act.
"i have to watch what i say from here on out for a little while because the eye of sauron is upon me," topp said as he left, likening caf to the primary antagonist in "the lord of the rings."
one of the jailed freedom convoy leaders has been banned from speaking her mind, at least on social media, as a condition of keeping her freedom.
the government argued last month that tamara lich should be sent back to jail for violating her march bail conditions, which included a ban on supporting anything "related" to the freedom convoy, including on social media, and travel to ontario.
a supporter sent her a pendant emblazoned with a truck image and the words "freedom" and "canada" and asked for a photo of her wearing it, which lich gave permission to post, the cbc reported.
she also accepted jccf's george jonas freedom award for "spending 18 days unjustly jailed" for leading a "peaceful protest" against covid mandates. the award ceremony is june 16 in toronto, but lich testified she wouldn't attend without court permission.
justice kevin phillips agreed these actions didn't violate her bail conditions and amended them to let her travel to ontario but not downtown ottawa, which had been paralyzed by the convoy. even though he said canadian courts "are not the thought police," phillips refused to lift the social media ban because that would facilitate "toxic groupthink," jccf said after the hearing.

this is based on inaccurate data, which has now been withdrawn.
a tiktok clip posted to instagram falsely claims that official data shows the number of deaths among us military personnel rose by 1,100% in the first 10 months in 2021.
while the people in the clip, which features us right-wing pastor rick wiles and appears to be taken from his website trunews, do not directly refer to covid-19 vaccines, text embedded in the video states: “admitted - hiv protein added to shot”.

us military deaths didn’t rise by 1,100%
the claim of a huge spike in deaths among us military personnel in 2021 emerged in january 2022, when data published via the defense medical epidemiology database (dmed) was cited by an ohio lawyer representing three “whistleblowers” at a panel discussion on covid-19 vaccines.
the dmed is a publicly-accessible resource containing both current and historical data on diseases and medical events experienced by members of the us military.
after it emerged that the data for 2021 showed an alarming increase in deaths and incidences of medical conditions such as cancer, peter graves, spokesperson for the defense health agency’s armed forces surveillance division, told us fact checkers politifact that the division had reviewed data in the dmed "and found that the data was incorrect for the years 2016-2020”.
he added that the database system had been taken offline to “identify and correct the root-cause of the data corruption”.
the error in the data was the result of the correct 2021 figures on the incidence of health conditions being compared to an inaccurate five-year average for 2016-2020, which “represented only a small fraction of actual medical diagnoses” and so gave the false impression of a significant increase in 2021.
this inaccuracy has been highlighted by at least one outlet which originally reported on the apparent spike in illnesses and deaths in 2021.
we have written about this data being used to make inaccurate claims about vaccine risks twice before.
hiv protein has not been added to covid-19 vaccine
while not directly addressed by the speakers in the video, the embedded text on the tiktok clip states: “admitted - hiv protein added to shot [vaccine]”.
there is no hiv protein in the vaccines currently in use.
this falsehood may be linked to the fact that a prospective covid-19 vaccine developed in australia had used a small piece of protein from the hiv virus in order to induce a stronger immune response.this vaccine candidate was abandoned after an early trial stage in which some participants returned false hiv positive results.

spread the word
this is great. governments cannot do anything about the virus.
they have no power to do so, either physically/medically, or legally. none of their mandates do anything of any value whatsoever to reduce either deaths from the virus or transmission of it and that is also true of the “vaccines,” which are not vaccines.
florida alone proves that in the united states. it has no mandates that are enforceable anywhere for anything — masks, vaccines, etc. and it has the lowest covid-case rate in the entire united states, far lower than new york or california which have the harshest mandates of all kinds. far lower than vermont or any other state where virtually 100% of the population is vaccinated with the non-vaccines.
in fact, the more people are vaccinated — in vermont, new hampshire, maine — all those democrat-run states filled with people complying with the mandates, the higher the number of cases goes up there. most, over 50%, of the deaths in those states (over 70% in the uk ) from the virus are people who have been fully-“vaccinated.” but not in florida, where case numbers and deaths are dropping by double-digits every week, every month.
and those same results are happening everywhere else in the world where the results are reported — iceland, israel, the uk – which is why our government is hiding the statistics that it knows about the effects of the “vaccines” in america, and the only statistics that are available for entire nations is coming from those other countries – everywhere but the us.
the only thing the worthless, unelected federal bureaucracies are good for is spitting out statistics from the data they force everyone to provide them. and instead of doing that, they spit out mandates that are completely baseless in science and law.
and you won’t hear a word about any of that now from the new york times, cnn, etc., facebook, twitter, the platforms that echo whatever they receive from the new york times, all of whom have been lying all along and pretending that florida has been a virtual death camp run by the “evil” governor desantis who refuses to impose any of those mandates on his state. they have been lying along with the federal government about every aspect of this virus and the “vaccines” all along.
and the one thing they will never do is admit that they have been wrong and lying all along about everything and that governor desantis has been right. like marxists throughout the world, their own actions bring about disaster, and they always blame someone else.
and it is child abuse and medical malpractice to even think about giving these “vaccines” to any child who does not have multiple comorbidities — unless his parents want it, of course. it is beyond monstrous to force children to have it forced on them by government mandate, subjecting them and their immune systems to experimental chemicals whose relatively short-term, let alone long-term, the adverse potential is completely unknown, literally turning entire populations of children into guinea pigs for no medical reason whatsoever, since their chance of dying from the virus is literally one in 2 million. yes, that is the actual statistic.
a total of 92 children, out of 48 million, have died with, not from, but with the virus this entire time in the us. and if you tell that to any true-believer democrat he/she literally won’t believe you. all they have heard from joe biden and the teachers unions and the federal government bureaucrats and the fake news “media” is the terrible peril their children are in, or the terrible risk their teachers are in if they are exposed to the children, none of which is true at all.
and it is right in the cdc’s own statistics, although you have to dig deep in them to find it since they do nothing to make it clear.
the total number of children who have died with, not from, the virus since march 2020, is fewer children than have been shot by guns in chicago alone in 2021, fewer than the number of children struck by lightning, or dying in automobile accidents.
and yet look at the panic they, the marxist blob, joe biden and the unelected federal government bureaucrats, and their social media and fake news propaganda organs in unison all have been and are, deliberately inciting in children and their parents about their children’s supposedly, according to them, highly-likely death from the virus — deaths which statistics prove are, in fact, a virtual impossibility, not even a remote possibility under any circumstance.
not a single child without multiple comorbidities has died from the virus in the us or anywhere else.
and yet they, the marxist blob have been intent on terrifying those children and their parents into obeying all their idiotic mandates, like wearing masks, and now getting the quasi-“vaccines,” which are obviously less effective against the virus than flu shots are against the flu, with promises of salvation from the virus and all the hysteria they themselves have engendered, salvation which never happens, because nothing they demand ever actually works, resulting in the marxist blob needing to blame someone else — again, as it always does about the terrible, real-life consequences of all its actions and its mandates, its use of force against the citizens for no purpose other than to display and rejoice in its own, completely-illegitimate power over them.
that is why even europeans are refusing to permit “vaccines” for children. and yet biden and fauci can’t wait to stick it to all the kids in america and destroy people’s lives if they refuse to comply with their fascist demands, demands which have no basis whatsoever in medicine nor in the constitution.
all that mandates of any kind, mandates forbidden (because it does not specifically permit such) by the constitution to be issued by the executive branch of the federal government, do is take away peoples’ freedom and destroy the countries that are subjected to them, spreading fear and panic among the population.
the federal government is literally powerless against the virus, powerless in every sense. and it is despicable that it, the government which has become just another cog in the marxist blob, refuses to accept, let alone admit, that very fact.
the pathological-liar sociopath career-bureaucrat fauci needs to be fired, his entire bureaucracy-department needs to be eliminated, all the money for research it controls needs to be returned to the treasury, and he and anyone who has been acting in concert with him need to be prosecuted, because he has known all, or most, of this all along, and he personally participated in the creation of the virus, against the orders of both presidents obama and trump, by giving us taxpayers’ money to the chinese military’s bio-weapons lab in wuhan doing research to create viruses like this, performing “gain-of-function” research, as it is euphemistically called, and he has been using all of his mandates he’s been coming up with as gaslighting to divert attention from that very fact, the arsonist rushing to the fire he created to “save” everyone.
and the sock-puppet marxist joe biden can’t find enough mandates to impose on americans to destroy the economy, which he is actively attempting to do in every single action he takes, and turn americans against each other, and fill the nation with terror unnecessarily and with no scientific basis, about a virus which is relatively harmless to the general public, anyone who does not have multiple comorbidities. the cdc’s own data proves that.

https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/10/navy-has-discharged-nearly-2000-sailors-for-refusing-covid-vaccine/
the number of u.s. navy sailors released from service for refusing covid vaccination is nearing 2,000.
a total of 1,893 sailors have been “separated” for refusing the covid vaccine, according to the navy’s latest report. that’s 180 more than were reported last month, according to usni news.
more than 81 percent of those released so far have been active-duty sailors and 17 percent have been reservists, all of whom were honorably discharged.
this news comes as lawmakers demand to know when the military-wide mandate will end, and the navy faces a class action lawsuit over the mandate from within its own ranks, with plaintiffs including more than two dozen seals.
an injunction in the class action case keeps the navy’s vaccine refusers from being punished as long as they file for a religious exemption. requests for those have been made by 3,318 active-duty sailors and 859 reservists.
oral testimony in the case is scheduled to begin the week of feb. 6, 2023 in the fifth circuit court of appeals, usni news reported.
the navy has granted 28 permanent medical exemptions to active-duty sailors and reservists, as well as 221 temporary medical exemptions.
almost 2,500 active-duty sailors remain to be vaccinated, while more than 390,000 navy service members have been fully vaccinated since that was made mandatory throughout the military in late 2021, according to a dod dashboard.
the marine corps has let go of even more vaccine refusers than the navy. that branch has discharged 3,511 marines to date, according to its october report.
in the army, 1,777 active-duty soldiers have been separated amid a 97 percent rate of full vaccination, according to the branch’s october report.
the air force hasn’t reported a separation total since its july report, when 834 service members had been discharged.
the department of defense has administered more than 8.7 million doses of covid vaccines, according to the dashboard.

on tuesday, october 18, active duty officers in the us military will speak at a press conference calling for an end to the dod’s unlawful covid-19 mandates and expose the harsh and unjust treatment that 80,000+ unvaccinated service members continue to face.
these service members will join their attorney, dale saran esq., who will provide updates to the cases he is litigating in federal court against the military covid-19 vaccine mandate.
the gateway pundit’s jim hoft has interviewed several members of the military to discuss the unjust treatment that they and their fellow military members have been subjected to under the unlawful mandate.
the mandate has forced thousands out of military service and discouraged new recruits from joining. military recruiting and retention is suffering.

lt. john bowes submitted a request for a religious accommodation last year to the us military to excuse him from taking the experimental covid vaccine, a request that was later denied. lt. bowes has been grounded since the denial last september.
fighter pilot capt. tom stewart, usmc, described his personal story of challenging the us military vaccine mandates. this included the unlawful process they used to ground us pilots back in september, wasting nine months of manpower and resources.
in may of 2022, over 500 members of the military filed a lawsuit against the government arguing that the vaccine mandate is illegal because there is no approved vaccine available in the us.
from the press release:
advisory risking careers, active-duty military officers to call for an end to unlawful dod vaccine mandates attorney dale saran to provide legal updates; officers will give firsthand accounts of dod’s coercive tactics that punish soldiers, threaten constitution and military readiness less than 20 years have passed since the failed anthrax vaccine immunization program (avip), in which a judge ruled against compulsory vaccination using emergency-use authorized (eua) products. using the same tactics of coercion and punishment from the anthrax vaccine mandate, the department of defense is now unlawfully forcing service members to take experimental, eua covid-19 vaccines. military readiness, constitutional rights, and national security are all at risk due to the mandates. some of the officers recently discussed these issues on bret weinstein’s dark horse podcast, “support and defend: military whistleblowers confront a rogue chain of command.” saran and his clients seek redress and hope to bring public awareness to these unlawful mandates and the issues plaguing our military.
stay tuned for details about what is shared at the press conference.

burkina faso’s coup leader-turned-president defended his military takeover on friday, though he acknowledged it was “perhaps reprehensible” and inconsistent with the united nations’ values.
lt. col. paul henri sandaogo damiba said the overthrow of the democratically elected president in january was “necessary and indispensable.”
“it was, above all, an issue of survival for our nation,” he said. that’s even if it was “perhaps reprehensible in terms of the principles held dear by the united nations and the international community as a whole.”
burkina faso’s coup came in the wake of similar takeovers in mali and in guinea, heightening fears of a rollback of democracy in west africa. none of the juntas has committed to a date for new elections.
many in burkina faso, however, supported the military takeover, frustrated with the previous government’s inability to stem islamic extremist violence that has killed thousands and displaced at least 2 million.
yet the violence has failed to wane in the months since damiba took over. earlier this month, he also took over the position of defense minister after dismissing a brigadier general from the post.
the burkina faso leader said friday that his transitional government will remain in power for almost two more years despite calls from west african neighbors for a quicker return to democratic rule. but damiba gave no precise date for the holding of new elections in his speech to the u.n. general assembly.
he warned, however, that the islamic insurgency embroiling burkina faso has security risks for the rest of the world too emphasizing that europe “is the closest continent to africa.”
“no precautions or prevention measures will prevent terrorism from crossing the atlantic if the sahel is abandoned,” damiba said. “nothing at all will be able to stop the youth in the sahel countries and its surroundings from giving in to the temptation of perilous immigration to europe through the sahara and the mediterranean if these youth no longer have any hope by staying at home.”

members of the freedom caucus are urging republican leaders to postpone their vote on the massive annual defense authorization bill until next year unless the vaccine mandate is repealed.
the freedom caucus blasted the biden administration for continuing to coerce service members to comply with experimental covid vaccine mandates despite joe biden’s admission that the “pandemic is over.”
“on september 18, 2022, president biden admitted ‘the pandemic is over.’ yet, the president and his “woke” pentagon continue to force an experimental and largely ineffective vaccine onto america’s military personnel, and thousands of our best and bravest service members face involuntary discharges for refusing on religious or medical grounds – and the department of defense inspector general has raised serious concerns regarding the wholesale denial of vaccine mandate exemption requests,” the group wrote in a letter to house minority leader kevin mccarthy and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on tuesday.
“furthermore, even while president biden’s policies are pushing highly trained and experienced personnel out of the military, every service branch is struggling to meet its recruitment goals. this is irrational and unacceptable,” the letter states.
upon the gop winning majorities in the house or senate following the midterm elections, a new congress can revise the annual national defense authorization act, the group said.
“congressional republicans still have the opportunity to stand in defense of our nation’s military – if we stand united,” the letter states. “just as they did in july, democrats will need republican votes to pass the ndaa, and the house freedom caucus urges all republicans to hold the line to force democrats to reverse the policies of president biden undermining our nation’s military and its combat readiness, starting with the vaccine mandate.
new: the house freedom caucus to call on the gop to reject the ndaa unless dems reverse policies they say undermine the military.

the senate began its debate on the ndaa on tuesday. a final vote on the legislation is expected after the midterm elections.
“the measure would then be reconciled in conference with the house version of the ndaa, which passed in june in a 329-101 vote, with 39 democrats and 62 republicans voting against the legislation,” the hill reports.
in addition to repealing the vaccine mandate for service members, the freedom caucus is also demanding republicans “end the contamination of our military by radical leftists ‘woke’ ideologies” and investigate us involvement in ukraine.
“republicans must demand that the ndaa: (1) fully repeals the vaccine mandate and allows service members involuntarily discharged to be reinstated without penalty; (2) ends the contamination of our military by radical leftist ‘woke’ ideologies and the prioritization of politics over combat readiness; (3) halts wasteful spending on ‘green new deal’ pet climate projects; and (4) establishes a special inspector general on u.s. involvement in ukraine,” the letter states.
unless the demands are met and the ndaa is amended to protect service members and check the biden administration’s political exploitation of the military, republicans should delay passage until the next congress is in session, when the freedom caucus anticipates having “a new republican majority to comprehensively rework the ndaa to serve america’s service members instead of leftist political agendas.”
hundreds of service members across all military branches have been discharged over their refusal to comply with covid vaccine mandates.
most of the members that applied for religious exemptions were denied and then punished or discharged.
“about 16,000 service members have applied for an exemption to biden’s vaccine mandate over the past year. fewer than 20 exemptions have been approved — the marine corps has granted six conscientious objections; the air force, nine, and the navy has granted one exemption for a reserve sailor on the condition he must be fully vaccinated if he is called up to active-duty service,” the new york post reports. “everyone else who applied was either denied, and then punished or discharged, or left in limbo while the application makes its way through the administrative ranks.”
it’s unclear how many service members are suffering from covid vaccine injury.
while thousands of america’s finest were banned from serving their country for refusing to comply, with democrats using the military as a “social justice” experiment, recruitment is the lowest its been in years.
the army fell about 15,000 soldiers, or 25 percent, short of its recruitment goal in 2022, the associated press reported last week.
“according to officials, the marine corps, which usually goes into each fiscal year with as much as 50% of its recruiting goal already locked in, has only a bit more than 30%. and the air force and the navy will only have about 10% of their goals as they start the new fiscal year. the air force usually has about 25%,” the publication notes.

multiple u.s. companies are dropping their covid-19 vaccination mandates out of desperation to get employees back to the office, according to axios.
large companies are increasingly lifting their covid-19 vaccination requirements for employees, axios reported. after covid-19-related lockdowns caused the worst global economic downturn since the great depression and july’s gdp report revealed americans are currently facing a recession again, employers are desperate to get people back in the office.
“with many tools including vaccination, improved treatments and testing now available, there is significantly less risk of severe illness,” goldman sachs told their employees in a memo obtained by axios.
goldman sachs says they’re done with covid, in spite of @nycmayor eric adam’s and @nychealthcommr ashwin vasan’s outdated and unscientific employer covid vaccine mandate. the city looks foolish in keeping this nonsensical policy. https://t.co/ynfc410xxu — covid policy wire (@covidpolicywire) september 2, 2022
it’s been nearly eight months since the u.s. supreme court struck down president joe biden’s federal mandate that all large companies force their employees to either get vaccinated against covid or be tested regularly in order to keep their jobs.
“employers are trying to reduce any barriers to entry for new hires,” erin grau, founder of charter told axios. she communicated with executives who are dropping their mandates, claiming employers believe they are “expensive and time-consuming.”
“[companies] decided that the rationale for [mandates] had become weak enough that they don’t want to continue,” jeff levin-scherz, population health leader at willis towers watson added in an interview with axios.
however, only a few companies are publicly stating their plans to drop the mandate. cisco stopped requiring vaccination in june for “office entry, travel, event attendance, or visiting customers, partners, and other third parties,” according to its website. jpmorgan chase announced in march that it would start hiring unvaccinated workers again.
some companies, including google, edelman, boeing and meta are still requiring all employees who enter their offices must be vaccinated, axios reported. (related: google to fire all unvaccinated employees)
the white house did not mention vaccine mandates in their statement released thursday, calling on businesses to take certain actions to protect employees and customers from covid-19 this fall.

gatineau, que. -
maj.-gen. dany fortin faced cross-examination monday in the sexual assault trial against him, with both sides expected to deliver closing arguments in the case in the afternoon.
final questions for the former head of canada's covid-19 vaccine rollout focused largely on his public profile in the lead-up to his may 2021 dismissal and on his memories of military college he attended in st-jean-sur-richelieu, que.
he was also asked to explain details of the college campus at the time, including the floor plan of the barracks where students slept.
it's in one of the college dorm rooms that the complainant in the case said she was assaulted in 1988. her name is under a publication ban.
the woman told a gatineau, que. courtroom last month that she was "horrified" to wake up one night and find that a man was masturbating himself with one of her hands, while his other hand was on her breast.
she testified that after she made it known that she was awake and whispered for the attacker to "get off" her, a short struggle ensued and the intruder backed off
she said she recognized the attacker as fortin "without a doubt."
fortin has denied any guilt in the case, saying he never had physical contact with the woman or entered her room, and that they were not part of the same group of friends at college.
in court monday he reiterated that he wasn't close with the complainant.
defence lawyer isabel schurman has said she will vigorously contest the complainant's identification of her client.
during direct examination by schurman in french monday, fortin described the details of photos from the era, including one in which he identified another student with the same surname and the same nickname: "fort."
later, under questioning by crown prosecutor diane legault, fortin listed off the sports, excursions and other social activities commonly enjoyed by the recruits. he was also asked about his drinking habits at parties to which he said he would have two or three beers on a big night.
testimony from both fortin and the complainant during the first two days of the trial in september indicated that students' doors remained unlocked and that the outside doors of the barracks were generally unguarded.
the complainant's former roommate from the college told the court last month that she had no memory of an incident involving the complainant and fortin, but said she "blocked a lot of those memories out" because of her own trauma from the era.
the complainant's then-boyfriend, called to the stand by the defence, contradicted her earlier testimony that she had told him about the event right after it occurred.
fortin was removed from the vaccine campaign in may 2021 after an investigation into the allegation was launched, and he is challenging the removal separately in federal court.
military police referred the investigation to the civilian system later that month and he was charged with one count of sexual assault in august last year.

three cadets at the us air force academy who have refused the covid-19 vaccine will not be commissioned as military officers but will graduate with bachelor’s degrees, the academy said saturday.
academy spokesman dean miller said that a fourth cadet who had refused the vaccine until about a week ago, decided to be vaccinated and will graduate and become an air force officer.
in a statement, miller said that while the three will get a degree “they will not be commissioned into the united states air force as long as they remain unvaccinated”. he added that a decision on whether to require the three to reimburse the united states for education costs in lieu of service will be made by the secretary of the air force.
as of saturday, the air force is the only military academy, so far, where cadets are not being commissioned due to vaccine refusal. all of the more than 1,000 army cadets at the us military academy at west point, new york, graduated and were commissioned as officers earlier in the day and all were vaccinated.
the naval academy in annapolis, maryland, said saturday that none of the navy or marine corps seniors there are being prevented from commissioning due to vaccine refusals. that graduation is later this week, and the air force ceremony is wednesday in colorado. ahead of that ceremony, the us air force academy board conducted its standard review of whether this year’s class had met all graduation requirements on friday.
defense secretary lloyd austin, who is the scheduled speaker at the air force graduation, last year made the covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members, including those at the military academies, saying the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force.
military leaders have argued that troops for decades have been required to get as many as 17 vaccines in order to maintain the health of the force, particularly those deploying overseas. students arriving at the military academies get a regimen of shots on their first day — such as measles, mumps and rubella - if they aren’t already vaccinated. and they routinely get flu shots in the fall.
members of congress, the military, and the public have questioned if the exemption reviews by the military services have been fair. there have been multiple lawsuits filed against the mandate, mainly centering on the fact that very few service members have been granted religious exemptions from the shots.
until the covid-19 vaccine, very few military members sought religious exemptions to any vaccines.
lt col brian maguire, an air force academy spokesman, said a week ago that all four of the cadets had been informed of the potential consequences and met with the academy’s superintendent. and he noted then that they still had time before graduation to change their minds - and one did.
the military academies for years have required students under certain circumstances to repay tuition costs if they leave during their junior or senior year. often those cases involve students with disciplinary issues or similar problems. the costs can be as much as $200,000, or more, and any final decision on repayment is made by the service secretary.
across the military, the army, navy, air force, and marine corps have discharged as many as 4,000 active duty service members for refusing the vaccine. those who flatly refuse the vaccine without seeking an exemption are still being discharged. but the courts have stalled additional discharges of service members who sought religious exemptions.
according to the military, as many as 20,000 service members have asked for religious exemptions. thousands have been denied.

https://madisonrecord.com/stories/628655660-vaccine-or-retirement-air-force-officer-with-religious-objections-sues-government-on-deadline-day
benton – lieutenant colonel carla wiese sued the u.s. air force on july 10, rather than retire for refusing vaccination.
her counsel russell newman of nokomis, fla. filed a complaint and moved for emergency relief in u.s. district court.
the air force had set july 10 as her deadline to obey.
newman named president biden, defense secretary lloyd austin, and air force secretary frank kendall as defendants.
general michael minihan of the air mobility command at scott air force base also was named as defendant.
newman quoted a statement wiese wrote when she requested an exemption, that abortion is a sin and aborted fetal cells are used in making virus vaccines.
“i am made in god’s image and nothing is to alter that,” wiese wrote.
she wrote that the vaccines alter one’s genetic makeup.
“the receipt of this shot would violate my religious beliefs as stated above and i would not be able to practice my faith as a roman catholic,” she wrote.
“my conscience and moral beliefs would be directly violated if i receive this shot.”
newman claimed col. steven richardson interviewed wiese and concluded that vaccination would cause great harm to her mental and spiritual health.
he claimed richardson found no inconsistencies between her practices and beliefs.
he claimed minihan denied her request on the basis of a compelling interest in mission accomplishment.
newman expanded wiese’s complaint to dispute the value of the vaccines.
to hammer his point, he placed “sic” in brackets after “vaccine” to indicate someone else’s mistake.
newman claimed that since vaccines can’t prevent transmission, vaccination is a moot point that can’t adversely affect unit cohesion or mission readiness.
he inserted portions of testimony from peter mccullough, who testified as a vaccine expert in a tennessee case.
mccullough swore that centers for disease control documented more than 10,000 failures before may 31 of last year, when it stopped tracking failures.
he swore that no studies demonstrated a clinical benefit in survivors or those with evidence of prior infection.
he swore vaccination doesn’t make a person less infectious or protect others. he swore that it’s dangerous to widely utilize novel biologic therapy in populations with no information from food and drug administration registration trials.
he swore the risks outweighed any theoretical benefit especially among children and adolescents.
newman claimed every procedure, surgery, medication, and vaccination must have standard right of refusal.
he claimed vaccine makers must inform potential users they have a right to refuse, and he attached a janssen fact sheet showing such a statement.
he quoted a study of adverse reactions finding pain at injection site for 93 percent, fatigue for 72 percent, headache for 69 percent, nausea and vomiting for 26 percent, and fever for 17 percent.
he claimed the food and drug administration approved license applications but has not approved any of the vaccines.
he quoted a federal regulation that no investigator may involve a human being as a research subject without informed consent.
he claimed the regulation requires an investigator to minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.
in his motion for emergency relief, he claimed defendants have no authority to mandate a product currently being tested in a clinical trial.
he claimed that even if they had authority, they would have to accommodate wiese’s sincere beliefs.
he asserted her rights to bodily integrity, personal autonomy, and freedom from restraint and interference.
“this is still the united states of america and we the people are still a free people,” he wrote.
the court clerk randomly assigned district judge staci yandle.

washington (ap) — the air force became the second military service to approve religious exemptions to the mandatory covid-19 vaccine, granting requests from nine airmen to avoid the shots, officials said tuesday.
the nine approved so far represent just a tiny fraction of the more than 6,400 requested by air force troops, and they come as other service members are challenging the lack of religious exemptions in court cases. the marine corps is the only other military service to grant any religious accommodations, allowing three so far. the army and navy have not approved any.
the services have come under criticism for their failure to grant religious exemptions, with members of congress, the military and the public questioning if the review processes have been fair. all together, the services have received more than 14,000 requests for religious exemptions.
military leaders have argued that religious exemptions to any of the many vaccines troops are required to get have been very rare over the years. service members are required to get as many as 17 different vaccines, depending on where they deploy.
a federal judge in texas granted a preliminary injunction last month, stopping the navy from acting against 35 sailors for refusing on religious grounds to comply with an order to get the covid vaccine.
eight of the air force approvals came during the initial review process, and one was granted on appeal to senior air force leaders. so far, religious exemption requests from more than 3,200 airmen were denied, and another 3,200 are pending.
“the department of the air force determined the service members’ accommodations could be supported with no impact to mission readiness,” the statement tuesday said.
defense secretary lloyd austin and military leaders have argued that the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force. and all of the services have now either discharged personnel for refusing the vaccine, or put a system in place to do so.
the marine corps has discharged 469, the air force has discharged 179 and the navy has discharged 118, according to data released in the last week. the number include active-duty personnel and entry-level recruits who were still in boot camp. the army has issued more than 3,000 formal letters of reprimand, and fired six soldiers, but has not discharged anyone yet.
all the military services have said the exemption decisions are based not only on the individual request, but also on its impact on the unit, its mission and readiness, and the health and safety of other troops.
those who get an exemption and are allowed to stay in the service may, however, see an impact on their jobs.
the navy and the marine corps have said unvaccinated service members are not allowed to deploy out to sea on ships, where infections can more easily spread. those who have approved exemptions — either medical, administrative or religious — are assigned to shore duties.
at least 97% of the troops in each service have gotten at least one shot.

https://www.thedailybeast.com/rand-paul-ophthalmology-certification-scandal-why-it-matters
scarcely a day passes that we don’t find out something new and objectionable about dr. rand paul. the risk in the pile-on is that a real doozie will get missed, lost in the daily torrent. the recent news—his lack of standard certification as an ophthalmologist and its relationship to his self-anointing and self-created national board of ophthalmology—is just such a big deal. its specifics, however, are so complicated and unrewarding to follow as to threaten to place it on the endangered scandal list.
i am here to make certain that we don’t let this one slide. his decision to sidestep the standard way doctors are certified in america is—even by summer politician standards—slimy, lazy, self-serving, and, important to remember as we sink deeper into his muck, revealing of the real reason for his me-against-the-man shtick. (hint: he’s not looking out for you, mr. little guy). but before we read from the latest entry of the randiad, let me guide you through the mind-numbing world of american physician credentialing.
trying to gin up a moral issue out of the selfish power play is reminiscent of nixon’s view of the law as something to try to outsmart. it’s also disrespectful to the oddball but often courageous stances of his father and other giants of the right willing to fight on principle.
here’s how it works: to practice medicine legally requires a license issued by the state. eligibility for licensure is granted after graduating medical school and after passing a series of difficult standardized exams prepared by the national board of medical examiners. once completed, licensure is forever (assuming a person behaves and isn’t a total disaster). rand is a licensed physician.
but a guy's got to practice medicine somewhere—an eye specialist like dr. paul, for example, needs a hospital's operating rooms to ply his trade. and that's where certification comes in. whereas licensure is a one-size-fits-all blanket of general adequacy, certification is granted by a specialty board to indicate competency in a specific field such as ophthalmology (or medicine or surgery or psychiatry). certification tests long have been administered by venerable, apolitical groups such as the american board of ophthalmology (or internal medicine or whatever). the certificate is a national credential that, although not absolutely necessary to practice medicine, is more or less required for any doctor seeking an affiliation with a hospital.
it gets even more complicated, but hang in there; rand is hoping the distinctions are just too subtle for anyone to really care about. in the 1980s, american medicine decided that it should police itself. a little. so the grand old men of the various fields decided that already certified specialists should recertify once a decade. rand initially did the right thing and became certified; but when his 10 years were up, he decided he’d had enough and chose not to recertify. rather, he organized his own certifying program for ophthalmology based right there in his hometown of bowling green. he then appointed himself president of the group, which he named the national board of ophthalmologists, and better yet, declared his wife (not a doctor) vp and his father-in-law secretary. talk about convenient! it remains unclear what the nbo criteria for certification are; the organization appears to have no website or easily located documents (though it is registered with the state of kentucky as a nonprofit and claims to have certified a few hundred eye doctors).
all of this would be ok with me; i just took the frigging recertification test in my field and i hated every minute of it. it is humiliating and infuriating and insulting and a waste of time and money. indeed, i applaud rand’s sticking his tongue out at the gasbags who insist on teenage procedures (multiple-choice tests proctored now by cybersecurity) to assure that a doctor is certified in his field.
but rand lost me when he articulated the reason why he resisted. being a conscientious objector or pissed off adult simply wasn’t good enough. no, he decided to cast it as a high-end moral stance against groups that discriminate—groups like the american board of ophthalmology. and what exactly was their discriminatory practice? opposing civil rights maybe? nope—much, much worse. the old geezers who made up the test requirements built a nice little loophole for themselves: they excluded themselves from having to recertify—instead they were “grandfathered” in. and in so doing they discriminated against poor rand and me and thousands of other of victimized doctors. thank goodness someone had the strength to make a stand against the nefarious two-tiered system. ah the pure horseshit—true kentucky thoroughbred stuff.
trying to gin up a moral issue out of the selfish power play is reminiscent of nixon’s view of the law as something to try to outsmart. it’s also disrespectful to the oddball but often courageous stances of his father and other giants of the right willing to fight on principle. with his creation of a ludicrous home-brew “certifying board,” he has shown his dedication not to a movement but to the single goal of making life a little bit more convenient for rand paul. and here paul does appear to speak for his generation: he has given us the finest example yet of yuppie selfishness in senescence.
correction: an earlier version of this story incorrectly said that the national board of medical examiners was roughly the equivalent of the american bar association.
kent sepkowitz is an infectious-disease specialist in new york city. he has contributed to the new york times, slate, and, oh-so-briefly, o magazine. he also writes academic medical articles that are at times pretty tough sledding.

pfizer’s covid-19 vaccine, which was developed with biontech, was approved by the who for use globally on 31 december 2020. credit: shutterstock.
latin american countries have accused pfizer of ‘high-level bullying’ during covid-19 vaccine negotiations, according to a report by the bureau of investigative journalism published in partnership with stat.
government officials from argentina and another latin american country, which has signed a confidentiality agreement with pfizer and so cannot be named, told the bureau that pfizer demanded additional indemnity against civil lawsuits citizens might file in relation to pfizer’s covid-19 vaccine.
pfizer reportedly asked governments in argentina and brazil to put up sovereign assets, including military bases and federal bank reserves, as collateral for potential future legal costs.
although most countries have offered indemnity to vaccine manufacturers in the pandemic, these latin american government officials felt pfizer’s demands went beyond those of other companies or the covax facility.
according to government officials in argentina and the unnamed country, pfizer asked for liability protection not only against civil claims from citizens who suffer serious adverse events after being vaccinated, but also for cases brought due to pfizer’s own negligence, fraud or malice. documents from brazil’s ministry of health suggest that pfizer made similar demands of the brazilian government.
as a result of these demands, neither argentina nor brazil signed a vaccine supply deal with pfizer. the other unnamed country eventually came to an agreement with pfizer, but with a three-month delay, to the detriment of the government’s ability to get on top of the covid-19 crisis.
world health organization (who) center on national and global health law director professor lawrence gostin told the bureau: “pharmaceutical companies shouldn’t be using their power to limit life-saving vaccines in low and middle-income countries. [this] seems to be exactly what they’re doing.
“some liability protection is warranted, but certainly not for fraud, gross negligence, mismanagement, failure to follow good manufacturing practices. companies have no right to ask for indemnity for these things.”
in an emailed statement to pharmaceutical technology, pfizer said itself and biontech, with which it developed the covid-19 vaccine, “are firmly committed to working with governments and other relevant stakeholders to ensure equitable and affordable access to our covid-19 vaccine for people around the world.”
“globally, we have also allocated doses to low- and lower-middle-income countries at a not-for-profit price, including an advance purchase agreement with covax to provide up to 40 million doses in 2021.
“since the beginning of our vaccine development program, we have been in talks with more than 100 countries and supranational organizations, including in latin america, regarding the supply of our covid-19 vaccine. we are committed to supporting efforts aimed at providing developing countries with the same access to vaccines as the rest of the world.
“we will not comment on ongoing negotiations, which are private and confidential.”
pfizer has signed vaccine supply agreements with nine latin american and caribbean countries to date: chile, colombia, costa rica, the dominican republic, ecuador, mexico, panama, peru and uruguay.
these revelations occur in the context of richer countries being criticised for inequitably hoarding available covid-19 vaccine doses at the expense of poorer developing countries. who director-general dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus has declared the world to be “on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure” due to the stark inequity in access to covid-19 vaccines.
vaccine companies have also faced criticism for focusing on bilateral negotiations with richer countries, rather than on signing deals with the covax facility, the equitable covid-19 vaccine access programme run by the who, the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations and gavi, the vaccine alliance.
some healthcare charities have called for companies to share intellectual property and technical know-how to allow covid-19 vaccines to be developed by other manufacturers across the world.
latin america has been hit extremely hard by the covid-19 pandemic. brazil has the third-highest number of cases worldwide and the second-largest number of deaths in the world, according to the john hopkins university coronavirus resource center. access to safe and effective vaccines in the region would be invaluable for turning the tide of the region’s covid-19 crisis.
the company’s covid-19 vaccine, which was developed with biontech, was approved by the who for use globally on 31 december 2020.

photo: screenshot
the canadian armed forces says it is investigating after one of its officers appeared in a video speaking out against vaccine mandates.
maj. stephen chledowski is the latest serving member of the canadian military to have spoken out against government-ordered mandates and restrictions intended to curb the spread and severity of covid-19.
a video of chledowski in uniform appeared on social media thursday, as hundreds of anti-vaccine mandate protesters continue to occupy parts of downtown ottawa and block border crossings in other parts of the country.
it also came as hundreds of serving military personnel face the threat of forced removal from the armed forces for refusing to get their shots.
defence department spokesman daniel le bouthillier confirmed friday morning that the military was aware of the video and that what he described as "appropriate action" would be taken. le bouthillier did not say what that appropriate action might be, including whether criminal charges could be laid.
the military last year charged another officer with mutiny after he allegedly urged other members of the canadian armed forces not to help with the distribution of covid-19 vaccines.

https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/07/29/biden-orders-military-move-toward-mandatory-covid-vaccine.html
president joe biden on thursday said he has ordered the military to start taking steps toward making the covid-19 vaccine mandatory for uniformed service members.
in comments at the white house, biden stopped short of imposing a vaccine mandate right away. but he said he has asked the defense department to look into how, and when, the military will add vaccines to protect against covid-19 to the list of other vaccinations service members must receive.
biden said making the vaccines mandatory is important because troops often serve in places where vaccination rates are low and covid is prevalent.

"men and women in uniform, who protect this country against grave threats, should be protected as much as possible from getting covid-19," he said.
covid vaccines are now available on an emergency use basis. until the food and drug administration issues full approval for the vaccines, the military has said it will not make them mandatory for service members.
when asked whether defense secretary lloyd austin is open to mandating troop vaccinations before the vaccine is fully approved by the fda, biden said, "i know he's open to it.
"the question is, when is the right time to get the most bang for the buck," biden continued. "a lot of this is timing. i think it's going to happen, but ... it's still a temporary approval."
biden said he would not pressure health agencies to come to any conclusions on approving the vaccine, but said he thinks they will reach their conclusions in early fall.
vaccination rates are slowing in the military, as they are in other spots around the country. in mid-july, austin said that 70% of active-duty troops had received at least one shot of a vaccine, and 62% were fully vaccinated.
the pentagon's covid website said that more than 1 million service members are fully vaccinated, and another 233,000 are partially vaccinated. that equates to at least 60% of the total military force of roughly 2.1 million -- including active, guard and reserve troops -- who are at least partially vaccinated, though not all guard and reserve troops who have been vaccinated may be recorded in those numbers.
biden's directive, along with other initiatives he unveiled that are intended to encourage and make it easier for civilians to get vaccinated, come as vaccination rates are slowing and concerns are spreading about a more transmissible coronavirus mutation called the delta variant.
after the centers for disease control and prevention earlier this week recommended that even fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas of the country where the virus is rapidly spreading, the military followed suit.
the highly trafficked pentagon also reimposed its own mask mandates, even though its location in arlington, virginia, is seeing only moderate covid spread overall.
in his remarks at the white house, biden decried the way covid vaccines have become politicized by some, and praised senate minority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., and republican alabama gov. kay ivey for encouraging citizens of their states to get the shots.
"this is not about red states and blue states, it's literally about life and death," biden said. "i know people talk about freedom. i learned growing up ... with freedom comes responsibility. the decision to be unvaccinated impacts someone else. unvaccinated people spread the virus. ... so please, exercise responsible judgment. get vaccinated.
"it's an american blessing that we have vaccines for each and every american," he continued. "it's such a shame to squander that blessing."

the u.s. army is hemorrhaging people.
the army’s vice chief of staff, gen. joseph m. martin, confirmed at a house armed services subcommittee on readiness hearing on tuesday that the regular army is poised to fall nearly 19,000 soldiers short of its staffing target, or end strength, in fiscal 2022.
looking ahead to fiscal 2023, martin essentially said the service will be lucky to fall only 18,000 short of its goal.
shortfalls in recruiting and retaining national guard and army reserve personnel were not specified at the hearing. but similar shortfalls in hitting a target of 525,000 army reservists would come on top of the missing regular army soldiers.
“that’s alarming,” said rep. jackie speier, who chairs the house armed services subcommittee on personnel, referring to the end strength shortfalls at tuesday’s hearing.
on top of those gaps, the army may soon discharge another 20,000 soldiers, in both the regular and reservist forces, who have refused to get the coronavirus vaccine. army secretary christine wormuth has yet to announce a decision on those cases.
if all these numbers hold, the army could fall short of its goals by almost 57,000 over this year and the next, based on people who either leave, are fired or don’t join the service. and that’s not including possible shortfalls in the national guard and reserve.
the reasons abound behind the shrinking pool of those willing and able to join the army and to stay in it. the factors range from a challenging post-pandemic recruiting environment to signs of declining morale among those currently in the service to a population of potential recruits that has shrunk due to factors such as obesity and lack of education.
end strength a weakness?
for fiscal 2022, the regular army’s end strength objective is set at 485,000. but martin testified tuesday that the service expects to land at 466,400 soldiers instead, a shortfall of 18,600.
for fiscal 2023, the end strength target for the regular army is lower: 473,000. but the service believes now it could fall 18,000 short of that goal.
at the same time, the service may have to let go 20,000 soldiers who have refused to be vaccinated without receiving an exemption — about 9,000 in the regular army and 11,000 in the national guard and army reserve.
all told, those estimates cover 56,600 people.
‘unprecedented challenge’
speier said at the hearing that members “just got word” that instead of reaching the proposed end strength of 473,000 regular soldiers in fiscal 2023, the army expects the figure to be between 445,000 and 452,000.
martin confirmed the numbers and said the army is aiming to get to 455,000, but he added: “the question is whether we can achieve it.”
if the army achieves the 455,000 goal — and that is far from certain — the service would still be 18,000 below its desired total.
martin said the service faces an “unprecedented challenge” in recruiting due to what he called “a post-covid environment and labor market” and with many private companies offering potential employees lucrative incentives.
he said the percentage of the overall population of age to serve that is deemed physically and mentally capable of doing so has shrunk from 29 percent to 23 percent (he didn’t say in what time frame).
within that 23 percent, a smaller number have a propensity to serve, he added.
there is growing evidence that those in the military are less and less inclined to remain there. last week, the military family advisory network released a survey of more than 8,000 military family members. the percentage that said they would recommend military life had dropped — from 74.5 percent in 2019 to 62.9 percent in 2021.
the respondents cited strains on family life stemming from factors such as frequent changes of station. the survey also showed that 1 in 6 military families has trouble feeding its members — a problem that pre-dated both the pandemic and the recent surge of inflation but that has not gone away.
speier cited another issue that may reduce the desire of those currently serving to stay in the military: 19,000 military families, she said, are waiting to receive child care.
“mr. chairman, we might need to have a subsequent hearing on this because it’s pretty serious,” speier said to rep. john garamendi, the california democrat who chairs the readiness panel. “if we need to make some changes to be able to attract more talent, then we need to look more carefully at that.”
‘good order and discipline’
as for soldiers refusing to be vaccinated, martin said that a widely circulating estimate of 60,000 soldiers poised to leave the force is not accurate. he said the number is “less than 20,000 — but it’s still a significant number.”
martin added that the army is working hard to convince vaccine skeptics or provide exemptions for medical or religious reasons.
republicans, in particular, have been up in arms about the prospect of losing so many servicemembers over the issue.
“every effort should be made to provide for exemptions so we can retain the servicemembers we have,” said joe wilson of south carolina, the full committee’s second most senior republican.
michael waltz of florida, the top republican on the readiness panel and a former army special forces officer, said he supports “good order and discipline” in the military and understands that “an order’s an order.”
but, he said, leaders need to “constantly evaluate the costs and risks of our orders.” he said vaccines have changed from a potential threat to unit readiness to more of a personal health decision, since the shots do not have the protective capacity they once did, given that they guard more against getting severe symptoms than against contracting covid-19.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/military-vaccine-mandate-challenge-1.6287451
the federal court heard arguments wednesday from four canadian armed forces members facing disciplinary action for refusing to get vaccinated against covid-19.
chief of the defence staff gen. wayne eyre ordered all armed forces members to be vaccinated by the end of november; those who do not will face remedial measures, including the prospect of dismissal from the military. that deadline has since been extended to dec. 18.
the order follows a similar requirement for all federal public servants. eyre has also said his order is intended to protect the military during the pandemic.
in sworn affidavits, the four service members challenging the order say they are opposed to getting the vaccine for different reasons, including concerns about its long-term safety and religious grounds.
"i do not have the confidence in the government's declaration that they are 'safe and effective,"' lt.-col. illo antonio neri states. "more specifically, i do not believe the trials have accurately discovered and assessed all potential long-term effects of the vaccines."
and while eyre's order allows for exemptions on medical, religious and human rights grounds, edmonton lawyer catherine christensen, who represented the four military members in court on wednesday, told the canadian press their requests were all rejected.
the four service members argue that their constitutional rights are being violated and the threat of dismissal is extreme.
"during my time in caf, i have seen members convicted of serious offences and not removed from service," warrant officer morgan christopher warren states in his affidavit.
government lawyers have submitted hundreds of pages of documents to support their arguments that vaccines are safe and effective. they have also argued that if the four service members are unhappy, they should file a grievance with the military.
but christensen argues that would be inappropriate because the order was handed down by the military's top commander. if the federal court grants her request for a temporary injunction, she plans to apply for the court to hear the case in full.
federal court judge janet fuhrer reserved judgment following several hours of arguments on wednesday, christensen told the canadian press.
military has 98% vaccination uptake
the four armed forces members aren't the first to challenge federal vaccine requirements. earlier this month, the federal court refused to grant an injunction for dozens of federal bureaucrats who are also facing dismissal for having refused to get the shot.
department of national defence spokesperson daniel le bouthillier said approximately 98 per cent of service members have reported being vaccinated, and most of those who haven't are reservists or people on leave.
another 800 members have applied for medical, religious or human rights exemptions, though le bouthillier could not say how many had been approved as officials are continuing to push more people to get vaccinated before the dec. 18 deadline.
le bouthillier said the military will not dismiss any members "until remedial measures have been exhausted," and that the first of those forced dismissals is not expected until january due to "necessary administrative delays in the process."
"at any point during the process," he added, "members can change their mind and get vaccinated, at which time the member becomes compliant with the cds directive and the conclusion of remedial measures should be considered."

new delhi, feb 5 (reuters) - pfizer inc (pfe.n) said on friday it had withdrawn an application for emergency-use authorisation of its covid-19 vaccine in india, after failing to meet the drug regulator's demand for a local safety and immunogenicity study.
the decision means the vaccine will not be available for sale in the world's two most populous countries, india and china, in the near future. both countries are running their immunisation campaigns using other products.
unlike other companies conducting small studies in india for foreign-developed vaccines, pfizer had sought an exception citing approvals it had received elsewhere based on trials done in countries such as the united states and germany. read more
indian health officials say they generally ask for so-called bridging trials to determine if a vaccine is safe and generates an immune response in its citizens. there are, however, provisions under india's rules to waive such trials in certain conditions.
the u.s. company, which was the first drugmaker to seek emergency approval in india for its vaccine developed with germany's biontech (22uay.de), made the withdrawal decision after a meeting with india's central drugs standard control organisation (cdsco) on wednesday.
the drug regulator said on its website its experts did not recommend the vaccine because of side effects reported abroad were still being investigated. it also said pfizer had not proposed any plan to generate safety and immunogenicity data in india.
"based on the deliberations at the meeting and our understanding of additional information that the regulator may need, the company has decided to withdraw its application at this time," pfizer said in a statement.
"pfizer will continue to engage with the authority and re-submit its approval request with additional information as it becomes available in the near future."
reuters was the first to break the news. read more
pfizer had sought authorisation for its vaccine in india late last year, but the government in january approved two much cheaper shots - one from oxford university/astrazeneca (azn.l) and another developed in india by bharat biotech with the indian council of medical research.
both companies had applied for approval of their vaccines after pfizer, and their trials are ongoing in india. local company dr. reddy's laboratories ltd (redy.ns) is running trials for russia's sputnik v vaccine, which is expected to be approved this month or next. read more

the fda granted emergency authorization to pfizer and biontech's coronavirus vaccine on friday evening.
the vaccine, which was found to be 95% effective in trials, was designed by biontech co-founder ugur sahin in one day: january 25.
in fact, according to the wall street journal's podcast, sahin designed the vaccine in just a few hours.

the food and drug administration granted emergency authorization to pfizer and biontech's coronavirus vaccine on friday.
the two-dose vaccine is the first to be authorized in the us, though moderna's coronavirus vaccine will likely receive fda authorization this month as well.
after months of testing, the vaccine was found to be 95% effective in preventing covid-19 in a large-scale trial. its development process was unprecedentedly fast — no other vaccine in history has been created and manufactured so quickly. previously, the fastest vaccine ever developed took more than four years.
but perhaps most remarkably, biontech co-founder ugur sahin designed the vaccine in just a few hours in mid-january, according to the journal, a podcast from gimlet and the wall street journal.

a biontech spokesperson confirmed to business insider that sahin — who founded the company with his wife, özlem türeci — made a "rough design over one weekend."
moderna's vaccine also took just two days to design, as business insider previously reported. the reason both candidates could be designed so quickly comes down to the technology they rely on: messenger rna, or mrna.
the fda had never approved an mrna-based vaccine or treatment before. but now that the agency has granted authorization to pfizer and biontech — with moderna's likely to follow shortly — mrna vaccines could set a new industry standard.
how mrna vaccines train the body to fight the coronavirus

messenger rna is genetic material that tells cells how to make proteins. pfizer's coronavirus vaccine candidate works by injecting a small piece of coronavirus mrna into the body. that rna codes for the virus' spike protein, which is what helps it attach to and invade cells. that's also what antibodies target and neutralize.
advertisement

so the mrna vaccine spurs the body to produce the spike protein internally in order to trigger that same immune response.
moderna's candidate works in the same way and has been found to be 94.5% effective in trials.
utilizing mrna vaccine technology meant biontech and moderna only needed the coronavirus' genetic sequence to design a vaccine. that's why they could move forward so quickly.
how biontech and pfizer joined forces

on january 24, sahin read a paper in the lancet that described chinese family members who traveled to wuhan then contracted covid-19.

"what was most concerning is that one of the family members had the virus and was virus-positive but did not have symptoms," sahin told the journal. this meant that the virus could be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers — and had probably already spread out of china.
"the math behind it just showed me it will happen, it's just a matter of a few weeks," sahin said.
he decided to shift biontech's focus toward a coronavirus vaccine. the following week, sahin told the company that operations going forward would be devoted mostly to developing and testing the vaccine.
using the coronavirus' genetic sequence, which chinese researchers published on january 11, sahin designed 10 different candidates on his computer that weekend. one was the candidate later selected for larger trials — the one the fda has authorized.

sahin designed that winning candidate in just a few hours, according to the journal.
but biontech, with a pre-pandemic workforce of 1,000, didn't have the capacity to manufacture the hundreds of thousands of doses needed for large-scale trials — let alone the hundreds of millions it would need if the vaccine worked.
so in february, sahin called pfizer's head of vaccine research, kathrin jansen; biontech had worked with pfizer since 2018 on a flu vaccine.
"this is a disaster, and it's getting worse," dr. jansen told dr. sahin, according to the wall street journal. "happy to work with you."

the two companies announced their partnership in mid-march.

pfizer would manage the logistics, including manufacturing the vaccine in large batches and organizing the phase 3 trial, which wound up involving 43,500 volunteers. biontech, meanwhile, handled the vaccine's design.
pfizer and biontech announced that their vaccine was more than 90% effective on november 9. when pfizer ceo albert bourla told told senior company officials of the findings, people jumped up from their chairs, the wall street journal reported.
the full results of the phase 3 trial were even stronger: the findings, published in the new england journal of medicine on thursday, suggest that the vaccine doesn't trigger severe side effects in most people and is 95% effective at preventing covid-19.

advertisement
anthony fauci, the nation's leading infectious-disease expert, called the results "just extraordinary" and said they would "have a major impact on everything that we do with regard to covid."
the speed at which biontech and pizer developed the vaccine does not mean they sacrificed thoroughness, according to albert rizzo, chief medical officer for the american lung association.
"we're not skipping steps — we actually have better technology," rizzo previously told business insider. "why did it take two weeks to cross the atlantic back in the 1800s? well, we had to go on a boat. whereas now, you can get across the ocean in several hours."
the pros and cons of mrna vaccines
for decades, vaccines contained a dead or weakened version of a virus itself. then early advances in genetics allowed vaccines to use proteins made by the virus instead. that method was first used in the 1980s to develop a vaccine for hepatitis b. companies like novavax are relying on the same protein-based model to create their coronavirus vaccine candidates.
advertisement
advertisement
but biontech was founded on the idea that mrna could be used to develop cancer vaccines, hence its mrna-based approach to the coronavirus. one of the company's senior vice presidents, biochemist katalin karikó, first discovered how to configure mrna to be used in vaccines.

since rna vaccines aren't cultivated using cells, they're quicker to produce.
the drawbacks of pfizer and biontech's vaccine, however, are that people must get two injections three weeks apart, and it needs to be shipped at about -94 degrees fahrenheit. that requires dry ice and special freezers.
crucial questions about the vaccine also remain, like how long it will protect people from covid-19 and whether it can prevent transmission and asymptomatic infection.

defense officials won’t be allowed to give other-than-honorable discharges to troops who refuse covid-19 vaccines once the new defense authorization bill is signed into law.
but even before that, service leaders have opted for less confrontational dismissals as they are starting to process some of those individuals out of the ranks.
on thursday, marine corps leaders announced that 103 service members have been separated in recent weeks for refusing the vaccine, which was mandated for all troops by defense secretary lloyd austin earlier this summer.
earlier in the week, the air force announced it had booted 27 airmen for failing to meet the requirement.
related
punishment for failing to follow the orders could have included a dishonorable discharge designation, a move that would bar those individuals from eligibility for a host of veterans benefits, including gi bill assistance and veterans affairs home loans.
but maj. jim stenger, spokesman for the marine corps, said that in nearly all of the cases so far, individuals received dismissals with “general, under honorable conditions” designations. ann stefanek, chief of air force media operations, said that all of the discharged airmen were assigned status as honorable or general under honorable conditions.
“the department of the air force is following the intent laid out in the national defense authorization act,” she said.
the authorization bill, finalized by congress on wednesday, mandates that “any discharge of a servicemember on the sole basis that the member failed to obey a lawful order to receive a vaccine for covid-19 shall be an honorable discharge, or a general discharge under honorable conditions.”
the language was added to the bill by house lawmakers over the summer, shortly after the vaccine mandate was announced. while no pentagon leaders specified that they would be seeking severe punishment for the vaccine refusals, numerous conservative lawmakers tied the idea to their objections over the policy.
earlier this week, rep. mark green, r-tenn., and an army veteran, praised the inclusion of the idea in the final defense bill, calling it “a big leap in the right direction” for the military. he authored the original amendment on the issue during house debate over the authorization legislation.
“we must always stand for our brave men and women in uniform all around this world,” he said.
related
president joe biden is expected to sign the defense bill into law in the coming days, making the vaccine refusal restrictions law.
service officials will still be allowed to give dishonorable discharges to individuals who refuse the vaccine and commit other infractions, but will have to provide a broader justification for those moves.
army and navy officials said they have not officially processed out any service members due to vaccine refusal yet, but are expecting to do so starting next month.
deadlines for compliance with the vaccine mandates for active duty troops have passed for each of the four services. military leaders have said more than 95% of the active duty force have received the vaccine.

“trident order #12,” disqualified seals seeking religious exemptions from the covid-19 vaccine. seals seeking the exemption would be barred from training, traveling for deployment and conducting other standard business thus making them un-deployable.
the gateway pundit has reported extensively on the negative impact that vaccine mandates have had on the us military as well as the concerning use of the mandate to “intentionally purge” religious military members.
a recent tgp article detailed the grim details of the vaccine injuries faced by those in the military that were forced to receive it.
in august, jim hoft interviewed lt. john bowes on the fight against the mandate as well as the impact of the requirement on military readiness.
lt. bowes shared, “yes, absolutely. and let’s dig into that for a second and talk about just pilots i think are a good example of the national security issue that we face. right now we’re looking at a shortage of about 1900 pilots in the air force alone. and in 2017, the chief of staff of the air force said a shortage of 1500 pilots was a crisis, and we’ve grown that number by 400 now. and so to say that we are in a pilot crisis in terms of retention and manning and then to also discharge these pilots doesn’t seem to work out with our national security goals, especially in a time where intentions with russia and china are rising almost daily.”
in march, the biden administration asked the u.s. supreme court to reinforce its covid-19 vaccine mandate to groups of navy seals who remain unvaccinated, dishonestly claiming it “poses intolerable risks to safety and mission success.”
the pentagon asked the supreme court to intervene after judge reed o’connor granted a temporary injunction to a group of navy seals from taking the biden covid vaccine mandate based on their requested religious exemptions.
“trident order #12” has now been quietly canceled by the us navy.
zero hedge reports:
the us navy quietly rolled back trident order #12, an order denying religious exemptions for covid vaccinations, a few months after an injunction was issued by the fifth circuit court of appeals in early 2022 as part of an ongoing lawsuit brought by first liberty institute. the suit was initiated on behalf of 35 active-duty seals and three reservists seeking exemptions to the mandate due to the possibility of covid vaccines being developed using cells and tissues from aborted fetuses. this information has only become publicly available after a new filing in the case this week. trident order #12 made any non-compliant seals and other troops impossible to deploy and designated them as medically disqualified. this development runs in tandem with a growing trend among government institutions; they back away from their original draconian mandates but in a manner that reduces media exposure and avoids any admission that the mandates are unconstitutional. a communication order was circulated by the navy on may 23 with the subject: “nswc closeout to trident order #12 – mandatory vaccination for covid-19.” nswc refers to the naval special warfare command: “this order rescinds reference a,” it states, referring to “ref a” as “trident order #12 on covid-19 vaccinations.” the may 23 communication order also said navy commands “will continue to follow guidance, as appropriate, regarding covid-19 vaccination, accommodation requests, and mitigation measures.”
the decision comes as every branch of the us military struggles to meet 2022 recruiting goals.

harboring a religious objection to the covid-19 vaccine, service members of each branch of the military, federal employees, federal contractors, and employees of federal contractors, sued on behalf of a putative class and promptly moved to temporarily restrain and to preliminarily enjoin military directives and executive orders requiring covid-19 vaccination but allowing requests for religious and other exemptions…. an october 18, 2021 scheduling order (doc. 9) observes that a temporary restraining order directed to the putative class will likely not issue, but the october 18 order states that the plaintiffs may move on behalf of an individual service member subject to a circumstance markedly more acute than the other members of the putative class….
navy commander serves as the commanding officer of a guided missile destroyer in the navy. navy commander joined the navy in 2004 and has served for more than seventeen years…. on january 28, 2022, the chief of naval operations, the ultimate appellate authority within the navy, denied navy commander's appeal [of the rejection of a religious exemption].
the appellate denial letter assumes that navy commander's "religious beliefs are sincere and would be substantially burdened." however, the letter states, among other things, that "[a] waiver of immunizations would have a predictable and detrimental effect on the readiness of you and the sailors who serve along side you" and that the other preventative measures, which for the last two years navy commander has required of the sailors under his command, "are not 100 percent effective and must be implemented in conjunction with immunization to reduce the risk of mission failure." the letter declines to mention that the navy has granted 270 medical exemptions and fails to explain the unsuitability of the alternative precautions afforded the recipients of a medical exemption….
lieutenant colonel 2 serves as a logistics officer at marine forces special operations command at camp lejeune, north carolina. lieutenant colonel enlisted in the marine corps in 1997…. before joining the military, lieutenant colonel 2 received an abortion after becoming pregnant from rape. this experience caused lieutenant colonel 2 to develop strong religious opposition to abortion and to any vaccine developed with fetal cell lines. in the denial letter [as to lieutenant colonel 2's appeal of the denial of her religious exemption], … the assistant commandant questions whether receiving the covid-19 vaccine substantially burdens a religious belief because lieutenant colonel 2's objections to the covid-19 vaccine "could be made for every fda approved vaccine [she has] received" in the military. further, "assuming that covid-19 vaccination substantially burdens" a religious belief, the assistant commandant concludes that "the government's compelling interests in military readiness and in the health and safety of the force" justifies denying lieutenant colonel 2's request. the denial letter declines to mention that the marines have granted 234 medical exemptions and fails to explain the unsuitability of the alternative precautions afforded a recipient of a medical exemption….
the order deferring the motion for a preliminary injunction contemplated that some exigent circumstance might require more narrow and interim relief to preserve, pending the outcome of pending matters, the rights of a service member otherwise subject to some adverse action by the military because of the military's denying, allegedly in violation of rfra, a service member's request for a religious exemption….
the record as a whole in this action and the attendant circumstances support the motion by the two service member plaintiffs, and the motion is granted-in-part for the following reasons and to the following extent. the purpose of this relief is preservation of the status quo for a week to permit a reasonable and practical opportunity for a hearing and any necessary and additional submissions from the parties. the hearing on further preliminary relief as a result of the pending motion will occur on february 10, 2022 ….
the record in this action establishes that the two service members are very likely to prevail on their claim that their respective branch of the military has wrongfully denied a religious exemption from covid-19 vaccination. the record creates a strong inference that the services are discriminatorily and systematically denying religious exemptions without a meaningful and fair hearing and without the showing required under rfra (while simultaneously granting medical exemptions and permitting unvaccinated persons to continue in service without adverse consequence).
one struggles to imagine a wholesome and lawful explanation for the results evidenced in this record. the military is well aware of the frailty of their arguments in defense of their practices. those arguments both procedural and substantive, are rejected in an action that is distinctively parallel to this action. u.s. navy seals 1–26, et
al v. biden (n.d. tex. jan. 3, 2022) (characterizing the military's review of requests for a religious exemption as "theater" and granting relief to the service member plaintiffs). rejection on the same or a more encompassing basis is likely in this action (especially if the conduct of the military continues along the present lines).
the two moving service members face either (1) a most-likely-unlawful deprivation of their accumulated status and standing in the united states military, as well as prospective advancement and benefits, or (2) deprivation of their constitutional and statutory rights to free exercise and the statutory right to receive a religious exemption unless the military can meet the statutory burden of proof, which the military has not and likely cannot. on the other hand, the military faces a trivial, if any, prospect of material injury as a result of permitting the service members continued service under the same terms and conditions and with the same privileges and emoluments as currently prevail, especially because the military permits a large group of unvaccinated persons to serve without adverse consequence.
finally, the military is most likely unable to establish, and certainly has not established, that permitting the relatively small number of rfra objectors, even if every request for exemption (much less the two at issue in this motion) were sincere and successful, to serve without adverse consequences to their standing and the terms and conditions of their service will adversely affect the public's interest in the maintenance and readiness of the nation's military forces. in fact, the public undoubtedly has some considerable interest in maintaining the services of skilled, experienced, highly trained, patriotic, courageous, and esteemed service members, such as the two moving service members, in whom the public has an immense financial investment and who are not, to say the least, readily replaceable.
the secretary of defense and anyone acting in concert with him, as specified in and to the full extent of rule 65, federal rules of civil procedure, is enjoined through february 11, 2022, from diminishing or altering in any manner and for any reason the current status of navy commander and lieutenant colonel 2, including their assignment, privileges, rank, or the like. in short, navy

vaccine. we stood on science, fact, law, not “religion” and fetus fetishes with the goal of positive impact for individual servicemembers and their families, and the military mission. a comparison of our motive and tactics with the baseless “religious infringement” and “constitutional” claims of some current covid military refusniks reveals how insidious, cynical, politicized, and dangerous to our national security their tactics are.
unlike covid’s dramatic entry to world stage, anthrax emerged as a dod focus during gulf i for no apparent reason except anthrax and mideast terrorists exist in arid soil. anthrax is not a contagious bacteria or virus like small pox and covid, it is spores spread by direct contact, most commonly through the skin of workers who handle hides and wool of animals living in spore-infected soil, and possibly by eating their meat. anthrax has been used as a bioweapon; in wwii the british dropped infected cow carcasses to starving germans. the sole documented lethal modern anthrax attack was in the u.s. northeast, at one point attributed to a researcher in a u.s. army laboratory mailing a stable powdered anthrax through the u.s. postal service. to be effective against our military, it would have to infect many people at once, which requires aerosol delivery. to make such a delivery system from wild anthrax that would not also contaminate those who used it would require sophisticated engineering (the russians famously failed at it a 1978 68 fatality lab spill). so far, no such system is known to exist, and no anthrax attack occurred in the ensuing 20 years fighting terrorists on mideast soil.
anthrax has harmed our military through dod’s vaccine. first, dod committed to en masse vaccination without any clear threat and before it had a vaccine, much less safe and effective against a hypothetical method for an anthrax attack. to date dod does not have a vaccine proven efficacious against inhaled anthrax. no willing reputable manufacturer would invest in research and development because the civilian market is the tiny number of people who work with animal hides/wool. dod found an almost defunct manufacturer in mi who said it had such an anthrax vaccine in stock. it had something manufactured by a predecessor in the 1970s with a 1950s formula – a 40 year old formula predating modern trials and federal review, without proper storage for 20 years. the company was not a researcher. they cranked up the old stuff with adjuvants and gave it to us with no transparency on the risk.
second, the rollout was years of confusion on dose and boosters. it started with 4-6 jabs the first year then every six months forever with dire warnings of health issues and having to start over if any were missed or late, impossible to administer in the transient military. predictably, young healthy people were injured and losses to the military. especially for the active duty and junior ranks without private care before obamacare, reporting of adverse reactions was spotty. people could not get it on time because of duty locations and had to start over, ending up double dosed. others left the military before completing, with the vaccine unavailable privately. it especially affected the country’s large reserve where troop strength is transient but more vital to national security than most americans know. contrast with covid vaccines, among the most monitored ever in part because they employ new technology still in active competitive research. global vaccine companies are sharing efficacy and safety data with all levels of government, private physicians, researchers and the public. private physicians are watching efficacy and adverse reactions in their patients who include most of the military (reservists who do not get military healthcare). the adjustments in doses and boosters is warranted given our massive diverse population, the new technology and urgency of this virus – while the nation was still at war against mideast terrorists when it began. the overall success of the covid vaccines is despite unprecedented interference by political operatives and grifters driving panic, insane lies and conspiracy theories.
thirty years later, despite no documented aerosolized anthrax attack, hundreds of thousands of adherents to the “religion” pastiche have taken the troubled anthrax vaccine against a farfetched threat of an arabic terrorist anthrax attack, without “fetus” objections. they raise “religion” against only this vaccine that has scientifically unassailable high efficacy against rampant human-to-human spread, long-term debilitation, mass death, and crippling our health care systems, offering cult talk, conspiracy theories and grifts. they ignore the facts that most vaccines and even over-the-counter medicines were developed with human fetal tissue and dna, and that the covid vaccine was not developed only with aborted fetuses and does not put fetus parts (and microchips) into arms.
if ever there were a basis for conspiracy theories, it is the lurid and terrifying real and related facts of the only anthrax attack on americans and connections to our anthrax objectors group. but we still stood on science and law. those anthrax attacks occurred in 2001, shortly after 9/11, by mailed envelopes containing powdered anthrax. it killed a random elderly woman in connecticut. i and the two most publicized anthrax vaccine refusers in our objectors group, two connecticut national guard pilots, lived and served in connecticut. the federal government attributed the attacks to an army anthrax research doctor who was a member of our group. another anthrax research doctor in the group was close with him and claimed the government started a fire on her property to threaten her work. the army anthrax researcher killed himself when he learned he was to be charged. it shocked our group who certainly did not foresee such a distinguished member accused. the media had covered the problems with the dod anthrax vaccinations supposedly needed for a terrorist attack. all roads pointed to dod, until doj said they were wrong about the anthrax coming from army. today, anything similar with covid would generate mass media and mob conspiracy theories and lies, sadly, apparently even in the military.
staying the course with science and law, two years later a jag in our group (in his private practice) with the now renowned national security attorney mark zaid succeeded in getting a ruling against dod from the esteemed u.s. district judge emmet sullivan that servicemembers have right to informed consent for vaccines – disclosure of risks and right to refuse. that temporarily stopped the dod anthrax vaccine and forced dod to address some issues. by then the old shelf vaccine was gone. contrast with covid vaccine cases spewing conspiracies and religious exemptions which no court has upheld. there have only been limits to some regulatory powers over workplaces, and the supreme court upheld mandatory vaccinations of health care workers.
in sum, we will not hear science and law from military covid refusniks because there is none upon which they can prevail. when you don’t have the law on your side, argue the facts. if no facts, argue your personal “religious beliefs” about science and the constitution. dod cannot bend to fabrications, mob rule, and unbecoming conduct wrapped in “religious” cloth. the best way dod can stand for good order, discipline, cohesion, and morale is to ensure the discharges proceed only on provable facts and law.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-dropping-mask-mandate-biden-state-of-the-union
the white house will no longer require people who are vaccinated against covid-19 to wear face masks on the premises, beginning tuesday, march 1, a white house official told fox news.
the lifting of the requirement will come just hours before president biden is set to deliver his first state of the union address before congress.
capitol ditches mask requirement ahead of state of the union
the white house's decision follows a similar one from congress’ office of the attending physician, who said that masks will be optional on the house floor for the president's speech, likely avoiding the optics of masked lawmakers gathered for the event, two years into the coronavirus pandemic.
the nation’s capital is now in an area considered low risk under the centers for disease control and prevention ’s new metrics, which place less of a focus on positive test results and more on what’s happening in community hospitals. the new system greatly changes the look of the cdc’s risk map and puts more than 70% of the u.s. population in counties where the coronavirus is posing a low or medium threat to hospitals. healthy people in those risk areas can stop wearing masks indoors, the agency said.

mask mandates have been a hot button issue around the country, as many democrat-led states continued to require them in public settings including schools while a number of republican-led states left masks as an individual choice.
new york city announced on sunday that they intend to lift its mask mandate for school children as of march 7, unless there is a spike in cases before then.
